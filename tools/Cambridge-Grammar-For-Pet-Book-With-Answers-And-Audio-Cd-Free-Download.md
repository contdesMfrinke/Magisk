[00:00:11.03] Hello and welcome to the Cambridge Assessment podcast. I'm Alana Walden, and I'm here to introduce the first of our remotely recorded podcast episodes. In September last year, we hosted our first SHAPE Education Conference in partnership with the Cambridge Judge Business School. The event brought together experts around the world to ask, how is our society changing? And what do we need education to deliver for that society? Just over six months on, nobody could have anticipated the enormous impact of the situation we're currently in. In this podcast episode, Michelle Fava and Mark Andrews from Cambridge Judge Business School and Dan Frost, Learning Technology Lead for Cambridge Assessment English, reflect on ideas that are discussed at the conference around the need to create the conditions in which schools can flourish and how Covid-19 may be shaping the future of education.
 
[00:01:01.8] Well, first, I think this is not a teacher bashing or school bashing talk I'm giving. I think we have to create the conditions in which schools are allowed to innovate. And that is not where we are now. Schools are, I'll tell you a story. I gave a talk similar to this at a conference organized by a friend of mine who's a head teacher, and I was really proud of my talk, I went up to her afterwards and I said: 'So what did you think? Like Tigger you know, What do you think? And she said, it was great. So I said, So you can do anything different as a result of it. So she said no, I can't. She said, I can't take that risk. So they're an outstanding school. The money they get related to that measurement pays for the teacher salaries. If she takes risks with her and I'm serious, she's really serious about this. So she takes risks with that. She's risking people's salaries. It's survival. So first, let's take very seriously the conditions in which schools can flourish.
 
[00:02:10.24] That was Colleen McLaughlin, director of educational innovation at the University of Cambridge Department for Education, speaking last September at the Shape Education Conference. I'm Michelle Fava from the Cambridge Judge Business School. And today I'm here with my colleague Mark Andrews, also from the Judge and Dan Frost, who is Learning Technology Lead from Cambridge Assessment who were involved in the inception of the SHAPE conference. So SHAPE was an event hosted by Cambridge Assessment English in partnership with the Cambridge Judge Business School, which brought together experts from around the world. So investors, policymakers, ed-tech specialists, entrepreneurs, teachers and learners to debate what changes in society are going to have the biggest impact on education. So, Dan and Mark, we heard there how Colleen was voicing the concerns many of us have had in the education community. There's no shortage of wonderfully innovative educational research and development. But the conditions have not been conducive to applying those innovations. The climate of education was too risk averse. So now here we are six months on and we do have the conditions for innovation, but not in a way that any of us could have anticipated. Our schools and universities in the U.K. have been closed for one month due to the Covid-19 outbreak and education education's been shaken up considerably. So let's reflect on the conversation we had last September at shape in light of the present situation. Dan, Perhaps you can start by telling us a bit of the back story about shape and how did shape come about? What was the thinking behind it?
 
[00:03:58.63] Yes. A few of us at Cambridge Assessment English had been in conversations over a year or so with Mark and some others at the Judge Business School, and we are all trying to do innovative things. We're all seeing innovative things happening, but we're also seeing a lot of kind of same old things happening. So what's done on paper, in the real world, just plonked into digital. And also seeing stats like three percent of education is digitized and anecdotally seeing things which just look a bit kind of janky and they could have been done better. And we started asking ourselves how can we accelerate this change? Other industries are moving faster than education is and there's a huge potential but education is so important because it's how we get humans ready to be part of society. So if we're only doing three percent of what we could be doing, not that we should digitize everything immediately. But if we're only doing part what we're doing, how do we accelerate that? So we noticed that there were kind of silos of discussions happening. So at a policy conference, you would have policy people talking to each other. At an ed-tech conference, you have ed-tech people and some of those ed-tech people are not tackling much bigger problems, often, often less profitable problems. And you've got people in assessment thinking about just the assessment side of it. So we took a, we kind of noticed this and then we noticed how modern product development is done, is done in a very cross-functional way, because you because a decision is not made in silos, you have to have the whole team behind. You have to have all the skills. So that was our kind of 'Aha moment' we thought. Right. Well, how do we get all these people together? Last September was our first attempt. It was our kind of MVP attempt to getting everyone together, getting people like all the people you describe, the teachers, learners and tech investors. And so putting them in a room and asking them a difficult question with the implication that they have the answer rather than us, Cambridge having the answer. So that was our that was our starting point. And we are what we're saying now is exactly what you're describing. It's forcing the collaboration. It's forcing everything to happen at breakneck speed. The interesting thing now is what we do with with that.
 
[00:06:30.11] I think it is also right to say that when we initially came to the idea that became shape that we we came to it initially from perspective of new technologies and ed-tech but as we started to enquire more and more into this, we realize, obviously, that this is a bigger system. And that actually we need to have this cross constituents membership for this kind of event to work and for this discussion to have real and lasting benefit.
 
[00:06:58.26] So one of the themes that came out of that discussion was about uncertainty of the future. So how can we prepare young people for a future that we don't know what it's going to be? So Tim Oates was very vocal about that. So I'd like to play you a clip of him.
 
[00:07:21.81] And we know that the future is really, really uncertain, course it is. It's the future. I mean, that's the point about the future. It's uncertain because it hasn't happened yet. Now, I want to take that theme and really criticize some things about the assumptions that people have and the facts and figures that they give. The world has never changed so much. It's never been so uncertain. I can tell you, if you were in England, in 1348 30 percent to be will be dead the next year. OK, 30 percent. Look around the room. 30 percent would be dead. We had two agricultural revolutions, we had an industrial revolution with far more social change, dislocation to lives, the economy, where people live, what they did, their life expectancy during those periods than we are experiencing now. But I believe where we've really broken down is in responsible public policy and in public debate.
