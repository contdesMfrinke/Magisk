**Coffin Rock**, sometimes called **Coffin Hill**, was a large flat rock located in the Black Hills Forest in Maryland about twenty minutes from Burkittsville. It was easily accessible by an old logging trail. The name was a common term coined by trappers.
 
Long before humanity came to be, it was said that a dark powerful force resided in the area of the forest. A Native American tribe which was the first to enter the area, came to encounter the force. The force abducted a young boy from the tribe and sacrificed him atop a dark path on Coffin Rock, opening the boy's belly and letting it flow on the rocks of the place. The force supposedly managed to sustain the boy's life indefinitely, feeding on his pain over and over again in a never-ending ritual that refused to let him die. The boy's tribe attempted to send multiple warriors and shaman to rescue him but they were all taken by the force instead. Eventually, the entire tribe vanished without a trace.[1]

In March of 1886, eight-year-old Robin Weaver was reported missing and search parties were dispatched. Although Weaver returned, one of the search parties did not. Their bodies were found weeks later by a second search party at Coffin Rock, tied together at the arms and legs and completely disemboweled. Their bodies later vanished when the team left and returned with additional help to remove and bury the bodies.
 
The story of Coffin Rock, which once was and no longer exists, is the story of a great tragedy. It was a 225-foot mound of black basalt on the north bank of the Columbia River, three miles downstream from the mouth of the Cowlitz River. This rock had long been a landmark to the Indians of the area, and was noticed by the American and British explorers who first traveled the river.
 
Five months after Yankee Captain Robert Gray discovered and named the Columbia in May 1792, Lt. William Broughton of the British Navy traveled up the river for 100 miles, naming geographical features along the way. He called the rock Mount Coffin.
 
Broughton apparently chose Mount Coffin as the name for the stone hill after observing that the rock was used as a burial ground by the local Indians. The top and slopes were nearly covered with canoe-caskets and blanketed remains of the deceased placed different levels on the rock according to their caste in life.
 
Other explorers for half a century were to note and report the unusual graveyard until, in 1841, a mapping party under Lt. Charles Wilkes of the United States Navy came to the Columbia River to draw river charts. The party camped one night on the bar not far from Coffin Rock.

As they were departing the next morning, a fire began burning rather briskly in the underbrush at the base of Coffin Rock. It quickly spread to the slopes and soon burned clean the cedar canoes and the skeletons of the dead. Probably, Wilkes had planned the fire as a means of improving the ecology of the site, but it became another oppressive action of the incoming tide of the new dominant society.
 
Coffin Rock was included in the homestead which was staked out by pioneer Noyes Stone soon after the donation land claim program was established in Oregon Territory in the early 1850s. Ten years later, D.W. Bush bought the Stone claim, including Coffin Rock, and retained possession for 48 years.
 
In 1908, Mr. Bush sold Coffin Rock to Star Sand and Gravel Company of Portland. The gravel company soon installed a rock-crusher and began a methodical conversion of the rock into rip-rap material for dikes and jetties, and into crushed rock for roadways and foundations.
 
Roy I. Rochon Wilson was an elected leader of the Cowlitz Tribe for three decades and is the author of more than 30 books, including several histories of the Cowlitz Tribe. He is a retired ordained Methodist minister and current spiritual leader of the tribe. Wilson lives near Winlock.
 
The **Coffin Rock**, sometimes called the **Coffin Hill**, is a large flat rock located in the Black Hills Forest in Maryland, home to the infamous legend of the Blair Witch it is featured in the *Blair Witch Project* franchise. The name itself was a common term used by trappers.
 
Coffin Rock came into infamy as the location of a ritualistic mass murder in 1886. A search party looking for young Robin Weaver had vanished and were later found nude, tied together and disemboweled with strange pagan symbols carved into their foreheads. When those who'd discovered them returned with help, the bodies had vanished without a trace.
 
"They went into the woods prepared to find death, what they found was a desecration to humanity. At the site which trappers have often refered to as Coffin Rock. On top of the rock formation, the story of the torture inflicted upon these brave five men unfolded. Each was bound to the other. Each mans hands bound to the next mans feet, forming a solid structure out of the men. Blood at the edge of the hedges had indicated that this act had been committed while each was alive and able bodied enough to struggle. In the torso of each man the intestines had been torn out crudely. 

On each man's sun bleached face was inscribed indecipherable writing cut into their flesh with an eerie precision. The men still entranced by the horror of what had happened, left the scene to tell the sheriff what had happened and did not sketch the writing and did not remove the bodies from the rock. Upon returning, vultures were seen at the rock, but upon inspection the bodies had been removed by persons unknown. The search party claimed that the stench of death was still thick. And who ever took the bodies had done so in a "matter of hours."
 
Less than 20 kilometres west of the Yiling District's Yichang Xiaoxi Tower, lays Coffin Rock, forming part of the scenery surrounding the Xinping River Valley, which flows as the western arm of the Huangbo River.
 
The greater Qingjiang River makes up for part of the scenery on which Coffin Rock exists, which was known as Yi Water (calm and safe) in the times during which the Ba nationality existed as the Tujia ethnic group and that is where the significance of Coffin Rock lies.
 
Coffin Rock refers to the caves that house some ancient coffins, which are rather precariously placed very high up in the cliffs of that part of the Xinping River, on both banks, with the ones housed on the eastern side relatively larger than those on the west bank cliff of the river.
 
Coffin Rock forms part of the popular tourist area of the Three Gorges, so there are a number of highlights to look forward to, apart from all the history attached to the Coffin Rock, which in itself is an adventure since the actual reasons as to why these coffins were stored so high up in the cliffs isn't really all that clear to historians and cultural experts alike.
 
It is indeed quite amazing how people of the ancient times managed to get over 30 old coffins more 100 metres up into the cliff, so that is a photographic moment not to be missed, but one should be sure to have a look on both the east and west sides, since the coffins occur on both sides of the river bank cliff.
 
The three most visible coffins are those which are housed in the lower cave on the western side of the river bank cliff, so if one really can't make out some of the other ones (which isn't possible if you look hard enough), at least you can come away with the image of those three, to add to the element of mystery surrounding the area, if ever it needed any adding to.
 
The tribe gathered for a "santification ceremony" near theformer site of Coffin Rock, which was a 720-foot shaft of basaltwhere the tribe once wrapped their dead in grass mats and placedthem in canoes suspended above the ground.
 
After blessing a cedar branch, which is sacred to the tribe,Wilson waved the branch back and forth as he moved around thecircle. His voice cracked several times with emotion. With his armsraised, he prayed to the tribal ancestors.
 
"We, as a people, must move forward," Barnett said as the groupstood in a circle during the ceremony. "What happened, happened.This is one of these things that allows us to move from the past toa new beginning for the tribe."
 
In November 1805, Captain Wilkes of the U.S. Navy visited theColumbia River region to do geographical work. His journals say thecrew viewed 3,000 dead Indians on the rock. He and his party campedat the foot of Mount Coffin. A fire started and spread over therock, destroying all traces of the sacred ground.
 
"Today we passed the Mount Coffin just below the Cowlitz, andalso Coffin Rock, so named from these being the principal buryingplaces. The canoes in which they are buried are in great numbers.They are generally secured between two trees, about six feet abovethe ground or on stakes and being covered with a great variety ofornaments, gifts brought by their relatives and friends to hangthereon. I was told this is frequently done for several monthsafter burial."
