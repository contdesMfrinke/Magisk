Since then there have been 3 updates released by Samsung ( -S911B/EUX/doc.html) and every time I manually check for updates on my phone it says my software is up to date. I've tried safe mode and using the samsung windows desktop application - both which say my software is up to date.

Anyone come across this issue/behaviour before? How do I go about getting the latest August update to roll through to my phone? Stuck on May and bit concerned with not receiving the latest security these patches they provide in the update.

If you use this which contacts the Samsung FUS it will show you the latest version of EUX is indeed S911BXXU3AWGJ. You wrote XEU above, I'm not sure what this one is? Did you mean EUX? There's no firmware for XEU.
 
Odd, seems like my tool (the one I linked above) and the build information on samsungs website ( -S911B/EUX/doc.html) correlate perfectly with each other (see build information in the screenshot below). Maybe Frija is out of date? N.B The tool I linked too (first screenshot) also calls the Samsungs FUS too.



 
That last bit will never change to an EUX, it's unchangeable. It will be whatever it is based on who provided the phone. In my case it was EE so it will always stick to EVR. But that doesn't matter as I can still change the active CSC to EUX and the actual CSC will change despite having the EVR bit. The EVR at the end doesn't count for anything/do anything.

I looked at one of the tools that tried to obtain the latest EUX firmware from the samsung FUS but it keeps returning back a 401. I'm guessing the same is happening on my phone when I check manually for updates. But I've got S911BXXS1AWD1 and that's listed on this page: -S911B/EUX/doc.html
(for May). Don't know why I can't upgrade to the latest August firmware?
