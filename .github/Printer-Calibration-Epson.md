If your documents, spreadsheets or images are coming out of your printer with strange streaks or jagged patches, don't dish out money for a repair quote just yet. In many cases, a quick calibration is all that is required to set your printer straight. Aligning the printing head of your printer, no matter the manufacturer, can be performed quickly from your computer.
 
Click "Continue" to print the alignment page. On the Alignment Status dialog, click "OK" if the automatic alignment is successful; if it's not, clicking "OK" will return you to the Utility Main Window.

**Using ICM, ICM/sRGB (For Windows 98/95 Users)**If you use Windows 98 or 95 and your output devices (monitor and any additional printers you wish to use) support the ICM color management system, you can use the ICM calibration method.
 
Run an application that supports TWAIN and select Acquire or Acquire & Export to start EPSON TWAIN. Click Configuration. Select **ICM/sRGB** in the Configuration dialog box. Make any other settings you desire. Click **Scan**. The scanner scans an image using the sRGB profile.**For Windows 95 users** **Note:**If your output devices do not support ICM, make sure the check box is clear.Follow the steps below:

Run an application that supports TWAIN and select Acquire or Acquire & Export to start EPSON TWAIN. Click **Configuration**. Select ICM in the Configuration dialog box. Make any other settings you desire. Click **Scan**. The scanner scans an image using the ICM profile.**Note:**Adding or removing profiles on the Color Management menu of your scanner's properties dialog box will not affect the colors of your scanned images.
 
Run an application that supports TWAIN and select Acquire to start EPSON TWAIN. Click Configuration. Check ColorSync in the Configuration dialog box. Make any other settings you desire.

I have an iMac, recently upgraded to OS X 10.7.3, and am using an Epson R2400 printer. I use PS CS5, with Bridge. What are the best settings to calibrate my monitor so that my prints match what's on the screen? As of now, most prints are much darker.
 
Calibrating both you display and your printer by creating custom profiles requires specialized equipment. As long as you are using the correct profiles for your iMac display and the printer your results should be pretty good, but if your prints are much darker it's time to go verify that you are using the correct settings.
 
First verify that you are using the correct iMac display profile. You didn't note which model iMac you have, however if you open the Display Ssytem Preferences and click on the Color tab you can view which display profile your iMac is using. It should say something like 'iMac'. If it says something else like 'custom profile' then you somebody may have created a custom profile for your system. If the 'iMac' profile is listed then try selecting it and reprint a test page to see if the issue is resolved. You can also click on the 'Calibrate' button which will walk you through a series of visual calibration steps that may help create a profile better suited to your specific iMac and the lighting conditions where it is used.
 
If you need to create custom profiles for both your display and printer then you would need to consider investing in something like this. In most cases unless you're a photo professional or graphic artist you won't need solution this sophisticated.
 
I'm an advanced amateur photographer, who exhibits in several galleries here in NYC, so quality printing and accuracy of color are important to me. I print anything up to 13x19", but anything larger goes to an outside lab.
 
May I just chip in to compliment what BofG just said.....I use a monitor callibration tool from Datacolour. They have an excellent customer service. As for callibrating a printer, strictly speaking you Profile sheets of photographic paper, which are then used as the ICC profile that you select when you go to print. Having said this, unless you are doing a lot of photography, and unless you are using many different kinds of paper, then It is far cheaper, a lot cheaper, do send away for a custom ICC profile, this is what I did since i was only using about two or three different media types. All you do is download their chosen image that you use to print on your media (it is a complex series of tones and colours - not a photograph) send your chosen photograpic media through the printer with the printer set to **No Colour management**and send that away to the company. Usually 15 euros per ICC profile unless you order one or two more then it is cheaper. Hope this helps in your decision process.
 
As a final word, some people, like myself, used to misunderstand the concept of matching screen to printer, that one is not so much matching screen to printe, since this can not in reality be done 100% accurately, though this actually does happen for 95% of tones and colours, **one is profiling for consistency between screen and printer,**this subtle difference is very important. Consistency means No dissappointment, and also means you know exactly which tones or colours need adjusting literally just before you print, which in reality are usually very very minor changes if you are perfectionist.
 
**Microsoft** - Like entering your home and opening the stainless steel kitchen door, with a Popup: 'Do you really want to open this door'? Then looking for the dishwasher and finding it stored in the living room where you have to download a water supply from the app store, then you have to buy microsoft compliant soap, remove the carpet only to be told that it is glued to the floor.. Don't forget to make multiple copies of your front door key and post them to all who demand access to all the doors inside your home including the windows and outside shed.
 
**Apple** - Like entering your home and opening the oak framed Kitchen door and finding the dishwasher right in front you ready to be switched on, soap supplied, and water that comes through a water softener. Ah the front door key is yours and it only needs to open the front door.
 
The spectrophotometer (or spectrometer) is a device that you place over your screen. When you click 'Go'' it analyses the RGB values and tones and white point of your monitor. The software then loads this into your system and your screen will change from its manufacturer's default setting to a new setting which will always be more accurate according to your ambient light temperature in your room as well. Which is why you should never view a computer screen with the sunlight from a window in front or behind you for example, and try to keep the lighting in your room at a constant, this affects editing. Your screen is now set for perfect viewing conditions provided that you always view your screen within roughly the same lighting environment as when you callibrated it. This calibrated profile for your screen is automaticallyloaded into your computer hardrive and used as the new setting for how all colours and tones appear on your screen You need do nothing further. An ICC profile for paper is a profile which is selected in the PRINTER when you go to print. It has nothing to do with the screen.
 
As above, you set a consistent working condition for your monitor. Not too bright, not too dark, RGB values nicely set so to speak. Now, you contact a company that specifiaclly does ICC profiles for any paper you choose. Go to their website, download their required image, put this image into your chosen software, AfPhoto or photoshop for example, now you print that image WITHOUT colour management, you set all colour management policies to either off or None, you print it, send it back to the company, they profile it with their expensive equipment, they then send you an email with a file that has an ICC extension. You right click on this and load this into your computer, and the software and the printer will automatically have access to this ICC profile so that when you go to print you select this paper and not a generic profile that came with the printer.
