**Rampage** is a keyword ability that gives an attacking creature a bonus to its power and toughness when it is blocked by more than one creature. Rampage first appeared in *Legends*; the last tournament-legal set with it was *5th Edition*, until Craw Giant was reprinted as a timeshifted card in *Time Spiral*.
 
Rampage had issues of development since all the cards with it were costed and sized like it was a significant bonus in every combat, as opposed to one that never realistically activated. Double blocking happens when a defender can leverage multiple weaker creatures against larger creatures, but none of the rampage creatures were large enough to require it. As such, an ability with no chance of activating is a poor design. Later cards such as Gang of Elk and Beastmaster's Magemark use an updated, non-keyworded version of rampage (**"new rampage"**, as quoted by Mark Rosewater) that activates against a single blocker and grows from there.
 
However, the variable stats during every combat added too much complexity, and while the cards were now more accurately costed, they had less raw power than those at the same cost, so the creature tended to lose races with their smaller size, given that defenders were discouraged from blocking. New rampage and rampage were both deprecated. After Beastmaster's Magemark, the design team went for a cleaner solution where instead of discouraging double blocking, the ability prevented it altogether, which already existed as stalking.
