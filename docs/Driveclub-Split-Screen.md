Some of the major points include that you will be able to earn the Platinum trophy without upgrading to the full retail version, though there will be a discount to upgrade to the complete version. A price for that will be announced in a few weeks.

There will be no local split screen multiplayer in DriveClub, which is unfortunate as I love local multiplayer. Evolution are also working on a photo mode so you can capture images and upload them, though details are scarce on how it will be implemented.
 
I also have this preordered with my PS4 bundle from Game and when i asked on the DriveClub facebook page they said this:
Leigh Bartram Is there alot of difference between the PS+ version and retail. I have preordered the PS4 bundle which has DriveClub with it but just wondering being a PS+ subscriber if it was worth paying the extra for my retail version.

*DriveClub* makes a few nods to those first two groups, but it seems designed to appeal mainly to the third group of time trial fans. If you enjoy challenging friends and strangers to overcome your best driving performance while answering the gauntlet from others, you'll quickly fall in love with *DriveClub*'s deeply integrated system of online challenges. If repeating the same track for an hour to earn a place on the leaderboards doesn't sound too appealing, this probably isn't the game for you.
 
As the name implies, getting the most out of *DriveClub* involves joining together with fellow players in your own "club" of up to six people. Club members don't actively race together in real time, but they do compete for the common good, representing their club in online challenges. For this reason, it's generally better to be able to form a club with other people you know in real life, but you can jump in to a club with strangers if you want.
 
Any player can set up an online challenge, on behalf of an individual or club, using an automatically saved recording of a previous race as the basis for the "time to beat." (There are also trials to measure who can perform the best drifts, which is surprisingly fun.) Once a challenge is set, other entrants can dive in and try to beat that time before the challenge expires. If an entrant at least shows up in the Top 7 they will receive some credit for the challenge.
 
Sometimes these challenges are lone time trials, but in many cases you're racing against your own set of computer-controlled opponents as well as the pre-set time. This can lead to an awkward splitting of your attention; you're struggling to jockey for position against the capable AI racers on screen, but really, you're trying to simply get the fastest time against human opponents who will race at other times.
 
When the pre-set time limit for a challenge is over, the clubs with the top positions are awarded Club Points based on their position and the total number of participants (the top performer in each club represent the entire group, so be sure to join up with good racers). It's hard to feel too invested in these awards, because the Club points you earn are the same ones you get for doing practically anything else in *DriveClub*. Overtake an opposing car? Have 500 club points. Drift behind a car for a top speed boost? Have a few hundred more. Drift through a turn or achieve a high speed or race somewhat cleanly through a section or finish a race in the Top 3? More club points for you! Bump into another car? Sorry, we'll actually be taking away 200 Club points for that one. This last one is especially frustrating when opposing cars bump you from behind.
 
As if that wasn't enough, *DriveClub* gives you more Club points for random section challenges inserted into each race, asking you to perform the best drift, maintain the best top speed, or drive the perfect racing line for a small portion of the track. On paper, these kind of randomized micro-challenges seem like a decent way to engage players outside of pure time trials. In execution, though, they falter by matching you up with a single random schmo each time, rather than judging your performance against some worldwide leaderboard. In one race, we'd manage to win a section challenge, and 500 Club points, by beating a pathetic drift score of seven set by some random goober. Later in the same race, we might lose another section challenge because the near-perfect racing line we set wasn't quite as perfect as yet another random goober. Without proper balancing or context, these face-offs against strangers start to feel random and unsatisfying.
 
In any case, the Club points you inexorably earn go towards personal levels and are also pooled together into one big Club level, both of which are used to unlock new cars and cosmetic customization options. You can also get points and set times in a single-player tour mode, but it feels a bit lonely and disconnected.
 
*DriveClub*'s challenge structure has a way of crowding out all but the best time trial perfectionists though. In an "open" challenge, anyone from any club can choose to participate, meaning a few pro-level competitors will often manage to crowd out the also-rans with the best times. Even in the limited pre-release environment (which had a few hundred active clubs), we struggled to improve enough to get "in the money" in most challenges with more than a few participants. You can send closed challenges that limit participation to a small set of clubs or individual players, which is fine if you already have a real-world rivalry with someone. But it's kind of meaningless unless you know a lot of people who already own the game.
 
It's all a bit sterile, though. Each race is its own self-contained nugget without much larger context outside of the Club challenge system. There isn't an open world to explore or a coherent career mode to advance through or any sense of progression aside from that lone Club points number that just goes up and up and up. This is an endless series of disconnected races and new challenge times to beat.
 
Hi Jamie, I have purchased the PS+ Upgrade version of Driveclub. I have seen Driveclub also work with the Thrustmaster T500RS wheel, which you omitted in your post. What I really want to know is, does Driveclub support the Clutch and Shifter for the T300RS or T500RS wheels?
If not why not? This is a racing game afterall..
 
Sony need to respond about the security chip necessary on controller on ps4 (or hopefully remove this perequisites for controller in next operating system update). What critical security this chip enhance to not give classic wheel support and let their users rebuy a 100-300$ controller for nothing. Particulary, on usb wired controller (not wireless), they already accept usb keyboard and mouse.
 
Guess I should be thankful to SONy for this. As this was the only thing that kept from buying the game and the console. And it turned out to be really bad, nothing like the ads. Last gen graphics, bad ai, bad controls, server problems, what else?
 
You need to have the drivingforce GT working on the PS4 as standard with all games. Its a disgrace if you dont having only Gran Turismo on PS3 being compatible so far. It has all the buttons and is simply a button map nothing more to make this work.
 
This is absolutely ridiculous that you are not supporting any Logitech steering wheels in driveclub. There is a reason why many of us bought Logitech is because they are far better quality than thrustmaster. Shame you could have had a killer game but just decided to throw all racing fans with steering wheels of a cliff.
 
I have four sons. I cannot get them to touch the PS4 over other gaming options in the house (PS3, tablets, PC) This move does not help me sell this to them. Also, Racing games are great, but few next gen racing games support local split-screen multiplayer. I am wishing I bought a WiiU. Mario Kart is looking more appealing by the second.
 
Sony please work with logitech to add the recent wheels they developed for your PS3 system to the PS4. This move only alienates your loyal fanbase. Please reciprocate that loyality by doing what is right.

puoi "rincorrerti", ma sarebbe possibile avviare una gara senza macchine ferme, allineate e indicazioni sulla direzione da prendere.
Skyrim e Oblivion sono preistoria. The Witcher ha dalla sua una trama che c4g4 in testa a Horizon (non che Horizon abbia una brutta trama, ma tra i due c'� una bella differenza) e non mi da la stessa idea di "piatto" che Horizon Zero Dawn mi ha dato. Cio� � tutto bello, la grafica, la storia, l'ambientazione, ma HZD ha qualcosa che manca, non so dire bene cosa. Resta comunque un signor gioco, roba che MS farebbe bene a tirare fuori dal cappello se vuole vendere qualche XBox (S o X che sia).
 
Ottimo discorso.
Ho preso forza horizont3 bello. Ma su asfalto � una cosa imbarazzante. Molto Meglio il fuoripista. Poi le istanze sono una cosa indescrivibile. Pensavo non ci fossero.

Poi a skyrim, oblivion e the witcher3 che sono tra i migliori action rpg, non puoi tirare gi� alberi.
Quest'ultimo citato non so se l'hai provato. Tra i pi� belli. Trama da sturbo.
Adesso sto provand
