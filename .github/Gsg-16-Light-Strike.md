After four days, we opened the wines. Susie put on a blindfold and Peter served her the wines blind, to avoid any prejudice. You can hear the results of the tasting on the pod! The conclusions were equally sobering and unequivocal.
 
Susie: No, no, anyway, light strike is definitely not good or cool. Sadly, quite the opposite. Now, to get some sort of perspective, you could put it like this. Most of us Wine folk are encouraging, whether actively or passively, the sale and consumption of Wine that is tainted. In the most extreme cases, your Wine can seriously end up smelling like boiled cabbage or drains or wet dog.

Susie: white and rose wines are particularly susceptible to light strike. Red wines are more protective because of their naturally higher levels of polyphenols. Now, what causes it are chemical reactions triggered by light, particularly certain wavelengths of light. So this needs, I think, a tiny bit of explanation. light comes in many different forms. Some invisible, like UV light, some visible, ah, depending on their wavelengths. Because light travels in waves. The kinds of light that are most damaging to Wine are those with shorter wavelengths in the UV-A range of the spectrum, which is invisible, and then visible light in the blue range of the spectrum. Now, for the light geeks out there, that is apparently around 370 to 440 nanometer wavelength.
 
Susie: 70%. I mean, this was surely the most interesting and shocking finding of their research. And the wines lose their identity as a result, chardonnay and pinot grigio becoming indistinguishable, essentially becoming generic white Wine.
 
Peter: In other words, every single still rose Wine was in a clear, colorless glass bottle. A significant proportion of the white wines were also in clear glass bottles. And also quite a few sparkling wines, too, particularly the rose sparkling wines.
 
Susie: And yet it seems we see more and more wines in clear glass rather than less. So the question is, why is that? Why are wines put into clear glass in the first place? So we asked panagiotis, flint glass is.
 
Susie: And if you think, just thinking about it, we Wine people, we get our nickers in a twist about cork taint, which affects what, anywhere between two and 8% of wines with a cork? Yeah, actually, probably less now, given the advances in cork technology and production. And we get worked up about other potential faults like oxidation or britannomyces spoilage or refurmentation. In bottle or whatever, which are all pretty rare.

Susie: Yeah. So we went to the supermarket and found a popular rose sparkling Wine costing nine pounds 99 in dark glass bottles. And this was important to ensure no or minimal risk of preexisting light strike.
 
Susie: All for a noble cause. Anyway, we bought three bottles. We got them home, and then we started the experiment. we decanted two of the bottles into clear, colorless glass screw cap bottles, adding some argon gas to prevent oxidation from being an issue. To be honest, though, the natural co2 in the wines would have meant minimal risk. We sealed these, clear bottles tightly, then put one in the window and one near a fluorescent light for four days.
 
Susie: Yeah. And interesting that for me, the daylight was the worst, I guess, perhaps because it can be quite strong and it includes all the wavelengths of light. and that had really stripped the Wine of character. It really had. and then the fluorescent lighting had made it more vegetable, which you might have thought was okay in terms of character. It was drinkable. but you could only really see the severity of the problem, the starkness of the issue, when you compared it to the original untainted bottle, which was just so much fresher and fruitier and more balanced.
 
Peter: Bottles or cans or whatever. And just to finish up on this, another paper suggested you could use coatings on bottles to block short wavelengths. but again, that gets messy when you start thinking about heavy metals going into recycling loops. These bottles need to be recycled, so.
 
Susie: Yeah. And then things like boxes or sleeves are going to get removed. So just use appropriate packaging. And this particularly needs to be borne in mind in an era where bottles are getting lighter, to reduce carbon emissions from shipping. So that also means they can offer less protection, even less protection from light. So, again, the same rules apply. The darker, the better.
 
Some wines are generally more susceptible than others. Most at-risk generally include white wines, particularly more delicate styles, plus sparkling wines and ros wines, according to Dr. Akshay Baboo, programme manager for wine production at Plumpton College, a centre for wine education and training in the UK.
 
More specifically, it is understood that light reacts with riboflavin in the wine and that this can result in sulphur-containing amino acids becoming oxidised, which may in-turn lead to the development of sulphur compounds.
 
For the more technically-minded, light strike happens when light reacts with riboflavin in a wine and photo-oxidizes methione, a sulfur-containing amino acid. The result is foul smelling thiols and thiol esters as well as the previously mentioned DMS. A secondary reaction between light and the tartaric acid in wine also forms glyoxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide that can cause the color of a white wine to turn yellow or brown.
 
Barrie and Richards also pointed out that clear glass bottles are especially problematic for sparkling, white, and ros wines. In particular, how even limited exposure to light on a retail shelf with wine bottled in clear glass quickly alters the aromas and flavors. Mind you the light issue rarely impacts red wines because they are protected by polyphenol compounds and tannins.
 
Using green or amber-colored bottles goes a long way to prevent wines from developing light strike problems. To that point, a recent article in the Food Packaging and Shelf Life journal (yes, there is such a thing) stated that green glass could protect certain white wines from light for up to 50 days.
 
Light strike can still occur in restaurant settings given how poorly wine is often stored. Then exposure to light may not be the only problem. I remember ordering a bottle of Barbera from a favorite producer one time in a restaurant in San Francisco, only to see the bartender grab the bottle from a row of wines next to the espresso machine. When opened at the table, the wine was the temperature of a warm bath. An ice bucket was quickly procured.
 
SO - when I make it to the range I will test to figure out what works, but in theory is it more likely that the light strikes are coming from the reduction in pretravel, the stoned striker face, or a combo of both? Or something else?
 
I would try replacing the striker spring. A 4.5LB spring should be 100% with most any type of factory ammo. A Wolff 4.5 LB spring should be the cure. Your spring could be a little weak and that is all it takes for light strikes.
 
Make sure there is enough over travel. Take safety plunger out and see if there are light strikes still. A lot of those modified trigger bars, parts, etc to take out maximum pre and over travel mess up the timing of plunger and striker clearing each other
 
There are a few things to check. All I use in my ammo are CCI primers and have no issues. So lets go through some things. As stated above a 4.5lb spring should set off all factory loaded ammo and all reloads even Tula as long as they are done right. So lets check some things.
 
What machine are you reloading on and can you set off the light strike round on a second attempt? If so that would be a sign of your primers not being fully seated which is a must for the Glock I use a 550 Dillon and I am a stout fella and I pretty
 
Check to be sure your spring cups are not being split by the end of the striker spring coil end. If the end of the coil is at the split of the two cups move them around and away from the split. This can cause just enough drag in the channel to cause a light strike.
 
Finally check your safety plunger and striker for any signs of them hitting each other at all. Even just a little contact (usually just a touch to much over travel removed) can slow the striker down just enough to cause a light strike. If you see evidence of impact (marks on the shelfs of the striker and nicks in the edge of the safety plunger) then you need to add some over travel back to the system.
 
If what you heard about the baking impacting the striker channel were true, it would seem responsible appliers of the cerakote should remove the channel liner beforehand. Why should the customer have to know about this and take pains to recover from it?
 
I damaged a liner in one of my Glocks with solvent. It was fine at first, but shrank a little bit over time so it was dragging on the striker. That one was never cerakoted or heated at all other than normal shooting.
 
Also - I've used 4 and 4.5 lb springs in a bunch of my glocks, and when used with OEM strikers, all of them had light strikes with CCI primers sooner or later, but most of them were fine with Federal. I've gone back to stock striker springs for those since none of my Glocks are range-only guns.
 
I've been down this road several times. Check ammo first since it is usually the number one cause of such problems, but if ruled out, and the striker channel is clean, the striker liner is often the culprit.
 
When I think of laser tag, I think of all the times as a kid I was warned about playing with the plastic guns outside for fear that the police would see the "realistic" weapon and shoot me dead in panic. These days, people mostly play laser tag in dark mini-mall rooms filled with generic techno, but WowWee wants to bring the world of futuristi
