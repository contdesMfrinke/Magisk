I bought a Ubiquiti 802.3at injector ( -accessories-poe-injectors/products/u-poe-at) but it only puts out 48V... so the AP is running in reduced power mode. Netgear support says the Ubiquiti injector isn't actually AT compliant because the AT standard is 50V+ (they seem to be correct!).

Additionally, it's worth noting that POE injectors are PASSIVE (a little known fact), so even if your switch is only 802.3af 15W, if the injector senses **ANY** POE power on the non-powered line, it will pass on whatever PoE it detects on to the powered port, and will not 'inject' it's own power (whatever it supports).
 
A parent instance (x calls up) does inject these dependences and as a solution I could pass them along, but I feel there must be a more elegant solution to this. So my actual question is: **Is there a way in Play 2.8 to retrieve the injector instance that is used by the application?**
 
Maybe I am missing something very simple, I am rather new to Play and Guice DI, so any help would be greatly appreciated. All the solutions that I found online refer to older versions of play, which do allow direct access to the injector or application objects. The examples from play 2.8 also show how to retrieve the injector, but only in the context of (unit) testing. Also, it is written primarily in Java, rather than Scala.
 
I see, thank you for the advice and for confirming that indeed @Inject is not an option since the class is instanciated outside of the injection mechanisms. Which makes sense, as the previous developers used:

I agree. The POE device would be powered directly by the injector and not the switch. Think of it this way, when you plug in a computer or any other non-poe device into a poe port on a switch, does the switch go ahead and send power to the device? Nope because it knows the device does not need any power.
 
Most of the PoE injectors from UBNT (and possibly other manufacturers) are Mode B injectors, so if you have a device that only takes Mode A power (pairs 1-2 and 3-6), it cannot be powered by a Mode B injector that has power on the 4-5 and 7-8 pairs. I never have encountered a switch that used Mode B.
 
A PoE injector connects your PoE-enabled network device to a non-PoE LAN switch port.More specifically, a PoE injector can be used to connect a wireless access point, IP phone, network camera or any IEEE 802.3af/at-powered device (PD) to a network...
 
If you use the injectors., they can be either at the AP and therefore vulnerable to being unplugged, or in the switch cabinet to keep them protected from interference. If in the cabinet, might as well use a switch!
 
switch when ever possible more control less points of failure. We have a device that is POE but we had to use the injector due to lack of POE and every time we have to reboot that thing its a trip to that IDF and pull the power wait and plug it back in. It is a hassle.
 
One way to ensure that an Ethernet drop will work reliably up to 800 feet (well beyond the specification) is to hard set both ends to 10 Mbps full duplex. At 10 Mbps it uses a different encoding scheme that will almost work through two Dixie cups and a piece of string And 10 Mbps should be more than fast enough for an IP camera.
 
Good thoughts there, Steve. I connected a laptop to an injector w/no power applied and it connected to my network. So I believe you are correct - the ethernet pairs appear to be acting like they are just wired directly across the input and output ports in the injector.

Aruba 225 requires 56 volts min. If it gets 48 volts, it will disable (?? if I remember correctly ??) the 2nd 10GB NIC and a few other parts.
 
Just did several outdoor IP cameras for a gigantic church, using TP-Link 802.3af POE injectors, and had a few that were over 300 feet, and the injector did not help at all. In my experience, it is a dumb device that it is not re-transmitting frames. We ended up putting a second 5 port switch around 200 ft mark and called it a day.
 
to repeat the signal at the 100 mtr point, you need a hub or switch, powered by PoE in, with PoE out. One solution is the WS-POES-8-7 or the WS-GPOES-8-7. This can be powered by PoE, and will then power up to 7 devices - subject to a roughly 30 total watt limitation. Have a look at that.
 
Can I use any POE injector for the EAP225? (As long as it has the necessary wattage, of course, but the specs say it's 802.3af so I assume any injector should work.) Also (total noob question) are there limitations as to where the injector needs to be placed relative to the switch and/or the AP? To put it another way, if I wanted to, could the injector be placed near the switch with a 50 foot cable running to the AP? Or does the injector need to be placed closer to the AP?
 
However (and this is also mentioned in the linked FAQ), this does not apply to TP-Link EAPs that come with a passive PoE injector (such as the EAP225 **V3**) - while it says they are 802.3af-compliant, they only accept one of two possible PoE wiring pinouts (mode B according to the FAQ). PoE power sourcing equipment (PSE) such as an injector or a PoE switch can be either mode A or mode B (or have different pinouts on different ports), and powered devices (PD) must accept both pinouts according to the standard. However this is not the case for "hybrid" devices from TP-Link (and other suppliers) - so you need to make sure your power sourcing equipment provides the required mode. Don't ask how I found out about the different modes :).

I'm installing a Cisco AP with a power injector. I'm trying to figure out how to find out the mac address of the switch port the AP will be connected to? I've read over several posts here that all talk about solving my problem by setting the power settings in the AP config, but I just cant figure out where to find this mac address for the switch port. any help appreciated.
 
"The injector H.H.H portion of the command specifies that a power injector supplies power to the AP, and that the AP connects to a new switch port with the indicated MAC address (H.H.H). Enter the MAC address (in xxxx.xxxx.xxxx hexadecimal format) of the new switch port where the power injector is connected."
 
if you enter the command "power inline negotiation injector installed", then the AP will write into its configuration "power inline negotiation injector H.H.H" where H.H.H will be automatically replaced by the MAC-Adress of the Switch-Port.
 
I found the easiest way of finding the mac address of the switch port that the AP is connected to is to console into the AP while booting it up. When it errors out because of insufficient power, the logs entries show the mac port the AP is connected to. This solved my problem.

The layout will be very linear - basically APs all in-a-line above the track. The only common point will be in the center which will be well over 100m from the ends. The APs will be mounted high so vandalism shouldn't be too much of an issue but it is something good to consider. Thank you
 
You can't use a PoE injector to extend the maximum range of Ethernet (which is 100m). If the overall length of the Ethernet is over 100m with a PoE injector in the middle, you are likely to run into reliability problems (or it won't work at all).
 
If you could run a fibre to a central location and then run 2 or 3 APs copper cabled back to that location, an MS120-8LP will likely give a better solution (and involved a lot less parts). It just doesn't stack up so well if you can only cable a single AP back to where the fibre would terminate.

>> binding commands will make other features like overriding bindings 
trivial to implementThis is probably not yet available - unless you create new Injector?Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(rewrittenModule);
assertEquals(new Pepsi(), injector.getInstance(Soda.class));Will this help with unbinding as well?
e.g. I have a huge state machine where services come and go, meaning I 
would still like to use Guice to handle my binding, but not for the cost 
of class leakage - unless Class --> Provider mapping is weak, meaning 
once I remove class's classloader that binding goes away as well?Cheers,
