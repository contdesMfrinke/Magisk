Hi all.
 I have and FBA product in the UK market, set up to be delivered only within the UK. I was wondering if there is a way to set it up to be sold as well in the Republic of Ireland, if so, how can I find out the FBA rate to deliver to Ireland? Is it the same as in the UK?
 Thanks
 David
 
Just to add to this. Amazon have built a new depot in Dublin.
 I cant seem to find much info on it but its there, I know someone thats working there. I presume its going to be used for Irish prime customers ordering from the UK, as there is no talk of any amazon.ie, maybe in the near future who knows.
 
I am currently using parcel wizard with DPD that use a Northern Ireland address, but from the 11th of December they will no longer be accepting parcels from the UK. Has anyone got any alternatives that they could share.

Theres also another issue with DPD shipping inventory to Amazon FBA warhouses from Ireland. Ive been told by them that they have no prepaid duty option set up, so that I will not be able to use them to ship to amazon warehouses. Im not sure if the person is telling me incorrect information or not. Anyone in a similar situation.
 
But the problem in those examples is that the API download/distribute/activate the parcel on all cluster nodes, I am not feeling comfortable doing that as if the script by accident specified a wrong parcel, it will screw up the entire cluster, is there a way to download the parcel to a certain host only?
 
By doing a test on a test cluster, I found I can directly activate cdh4.7 parcel without deactivate cdh5.5.1 first, and after that cdh 5.5.1 only shows an upgrade option( I cannot activate it). To re-activate cdh5.5.1 parcel, I have to go through the cluster upgrade wizard again and of course the wizard would fail in HDFS metadata upgrade step as the cluster had already been upgraded to CDH5.
 
Although I can do some safety guard such as make sure the parcel version is 5.5.1 before distribute and activate it, remove chd old cdh4.7 parcel etc. But I still feel not very comfortable to use the parcel API call for the entire cluster.
 
2: Instead of pushing a parcel to the entire cluser, admin has option to push to certain host. I know the cluster should have the same parcel on every host, but I hope at least make this option optional. CM can show a warning flag if not all hosts run the same parcel.
 
The question is that to add a new host to the cluster. Since the parcle is already downloaded, distributed and activated cluster wise, do I need to at least run distribute for this host? or I just run create\_host() call and parcels will be distributed and activated automaitcally on this host?
 
Over the years many of us has adopted the route of using virtual shipping addresses for online shopping which is a great ecommerce solution to get products cheaper and get products that normally would not ship direct to Ireland and with big players like parcel motel and parcel wizard this made life easier most of the time but come this time of year it does turn out to be a bit of a disaster, but time may be running out for other players going forward with Brexit.
 
DPD are the first to step up and tell us they will cease the option for its customers to use a UK virtual address to get their packages delivered and recently Parcel Motel decided to up their prices which is shooting themselves in the foot, however it may mean a good percentage of parcel wizard customers might migrate to the service just to tide them over the xmas period which could be a risky move..
 
With Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up this is typically a very busy period for the companies and to add to it Christmas does not help either and also recently DPD and UPS formerly Nightline have advertisements screaming for extra delivery drivers to cope with the demand over the next few weeks and this often runs into late Jan and sometimes later, Having worked in the industry some years ago it is a stressful time for drivers and become such a cut throat business with not so great pay and change is needed, staff turnover is huge and this is seen by the constant advertising looking for drivers throughout the year and in short needs to be addressed, I had a delivery last Saturday night in fact at 7pm which was a first and this shows the strain these companies are under.
 
From January 1st 2021 deliveries from the UK are changing due to customs.
When shopping online use your **Home Delivery** AddressPal virtual address (see below for address examples).
 
From January 1st 2021 payment for all AddressPal items must be taken from a Credit/Debit card that is saved on your AddressPal account. Without a valid card your parcel cannot be delivered. You will only be charged once we process your AddressPal deliveries.
 
For now however you can use the alternatives such as An Post( Address Pal/ Delivery box at your house) , Parcel Motel, and there is some drop off point/collect points, there is some other smaller operators around but this is not a service for ecommerce etc but more so intra company services and special sectors in some areas of business. There is also word of alternatives that might be arriving soon but more on that as it becomes more transparent and solid. But I would be looking at Amazon going forward. With Amazon being a key player and recently opened a warehouse here in Ireland it makes sense going forward and they are also seeking new premises from what I have heard and this is most likely to hold stock which would be a real win and the right route for Amazon to take with its customer base.
 
Parcel Motel has been the most prominent player in the locker business and have also issued notices to its customers however things could be weighing up different here as they claim their service is suspended with a new Virtual Dublin address just a stones throw away from their main office, UPS bought the business if you remember and have now in the EU more channels to work with there has been talk of amazon lockers due to the infrastructure already here but also setting up new bases in the EU which makes sense, Whilst many people shop on Amazon UK they have other stores like de and fr you can shop from and is often cheaper and this again makes sense for setup in such countries particularly for the likes of Amazon and also Amazon now have a base here in Ireland but this is not a fulfilment centre but does now open the doors for them to set up such warehouses and there is rumour they have been. Many in the logistics industry do know more and did know they where looking for units here in Ireland and that today still is the case. Amazon is here for the long haul..

@DavidDas\_\_GISP thank you very much for the tutorial and efforts! What you put together helps fills a big gap in Esri's Experience Builder documentation, namely, the lack of examples to help clarify the implementation and use of the various features, including the widgets. ESRI - TAKE NOTE PLEASE!!!!

Question: I implemented the Query widget for a couple of parcel feature layers we use. In Spatial filter, for "Geometries from a map," it will show the features which intersect the shape drawn (as documented). Is there a way to just return those >>within
 
**Question 1:** I implemented the Query widget for a couple of parcel feature layers we use. In Spatial filter, for "Geometries from a map," it will show the features which intersect the shape drawn (as documented). Is there a way to just return those >>within
 
Also, in "Selected features from data source" (n the Query widget), there is "Spatial relationship rules." I cannot find an example which clarifies the use of such, and how it would be helpful. Do you have anything to add to this, based on your experience?
 
Robert designed the **Enhanced Search Widget** for the Web AppBuilder Developer Edition that combines all the Attribute Search, Graphical Search and Spatial Search into a single widget that is simple and intuitive to use.
 
Regarding the issue of the lack of a feature which would allow you to select parcels Contained in a drawn polygon (as opposed to intersecting such), I thought I had a scheme but, after testing, it did not work. Let me explain, and perhaps you have an answer ...
 
Next, in Experience Builder, I added the Edit(beta) widget and tied it to the thre
