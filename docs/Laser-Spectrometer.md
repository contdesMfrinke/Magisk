They combine a number of important properties, e.g. a high sensitivity and a high selectivity with non-intrusive and remote sensing capabilities. Laser absorption spectrometry has become the foremost used technique for quantitative assessments of atoms and molecules in gas phase. It is also a widely used technique for a variety of other applications, e.g. within the field of optical frequency metrology or in studies of light matter interactions. The most common technique is tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) which has become commercialized and is used for a variety of applications.
 
The detection limit can be improved by (1) reducing the noise, (2) using transitions with larger transition strengths or (3) increasing the effective path length. The first can be achieved by the use of a modulation technique, the second can be obtained by using transitions in unconventional wavelength regions, whereas the third by using external cavities.

The recent development of quantum cascade (QC) lasers working in the MIR region has opened up new possibilities for sensitive detection of molecular species on their fundamental vibrational bands. It is more difficult to generate stable cw light addressing electronic transitions, since these often lie in the UV region.
 
The third way of improving the sensitivity of LAS is to increase the path length. This can be obtained by placing the species inside a cavity in which the light bounces back and forth many times, whereby the interaction length can be increased considerably. This has led to a group of techniques denoted as cavity enhanced AS (CEAS). The cavity can either be placed inside the laser, giving rise to intracavity AS, or outside, when it is referred to as an external cavity. Although the former technique can provide a high sensitivity, its practical applicability is limited by non-linear processes.
 
A problem with resonant cavities is that a high finesse cavity has narrow cavity modes, often in the low kHz range. Since cw lasers often have free-running line-widths in the MHz range, and pulsed even larger, it is difficult to couple laser light effectively into a high finesse cavity. However, there are a few ways this can be achieved. One such method is Vernier Spectroscopy, which employs a frequency comb laser to excite many cavity modes simultaneously and allows for a highly parallel measurement of trace gases.
 
By measuring absorption of light at specific wavelengths, TLS measures concentrations of methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. It includes a chamber called a Herriott cell, where a laser beam at a precisely tuned wavelength is reflected between mirrors to bounce back and forth through the sample of gas being analyzed. The laser passes through the sample 81 times, for a total length of 55 feet (16.8 meters), which makes the absorption easier to measure than would otherwise be possible with such a compact instrument.
 
The TLS technology from Curiosity is being tested for use on Earth as utility-company safety equipment to check for leaks in pipelines carrying natural gas. Methane is a major component of natural gas.
 
The SM241 is a compact CCD-based spectrometer designed for NIR laser applications. Spectral Products' IR up-conversion phosphor CCD coating breaks the standard silicon-based CCD detector's array sensitivity barrier of 1100nm to allow spectral measurements up to 1700nm. This technology makes the SM241 a lower-cost alternative to Germanium or InGaAs systems. The SM241 optical bench includes oversized gold-coated mirrors and gratings to accommodate NIR light collection and analysis. Maximum spectral coverage with this spectrometer is 900 nm to 1700 nm (reduced coverage window size within 900-1700nm will increase spectral resolution and light sensitivity). But although the SM241 can measure up to 1700nm, due to its low sensitivity, it is limited only to use in applications measuring very narrow bandwidth and strong lights like lasers in this NIR range.

Standard interfaces include a USB 2.0 interface and a PCI card interface with a 16-bit extended dynamic range. Software support includes an SDK and DLLs for dedicated applications development and our SM32Pro windows-based spectral acquisition and analysis software. Both standard and legacy interface designs provide support for advanced acquisition programming and external triggering.

Tunable diode laser spectrometers (TDLS) allow for real-time gas analysis to increase efficiency, safety, throughput, quality, and environmental compliance. The non-contacting sensor allows measurement under severe conditions, such as high temperature, high pressure, corrosive/abrasive conditions, high dust concentration, etc. Maintenance can also be performed without taking the process offline because the TDLS is isolated from the process. The TDLS is a robust process analyzer that contributes to stable and efficient operation.
**>>> Application Notes**
 
Various plant units and piping may contain pressurized, high-temperature, corrosive, combustible, and/or toxic gases which may be problematic for traditional technologies. The TDLS8000 can detect the concentration of process gas in real time without direct contact to allow for quick response to optimize process availability without sacrificing measurement availability.
**>>> Principles**
 
The TDLS8000 helps reduce total OPEX and maximize output safely
Example: The TDLS8000 can measure up to 30m over the entire length of a furnace at the top of the radiant section to analyze for efficient combustion. Based on gas concentrations, operators can optimize the air-fuel ratio and analyze heat transfer efficiency while ensuring a safe environment.
**>>> Solutions**
 
Sampling unnecessary, installation flange is only on one side, installation cost is reduced by half while keeping high speed measurement / high speed response. It can be easily exchanged from existing equipment.
 
The tunable diode laser absorption spectrometers (TDLAS) operate by measuring the amount of a laser light that is absorbed as it travels through the gas being measured. Because the sensor does not have contact with the process and there are no moving parts, maintenance is minimized, which decreases downtime and reduces the long-term cost of ownership (LTCO).
 
The TruePeak Tunable Diode Laser Spectrometers operate by measuring the amount of a laser light that is absorbed as it travels through the gas being measured. Involving no sensor contact with the process and no moving parts, it leads to a high mean time between failures (MTBF) and hence a low long term cost of ownership (LTCO).
 
Fired heaters are integral to industrial processes, including hydrocarbon processing and power generation. Specifically designed for the reaction of fuel and air to produce extremely high gas temperatures, heaters transfer this energy to potentially highly flammable process fluids via heat exchangers. They consume large quantities of fuel, produce large quantities of emissions and are a potential safety hazard to personnel and plant.
 
Yokogawa TDLS analyzers help control fired heater combustion with ever greater accuracy and reliability. There are measurable rewards for operating fired heaters at Low Excess Air (LEA) levels. In LEA combustion control, the lowest level of fuel is consumed and the products of combustion are cooled the least by unused excess air.
 
The cost benefits of these efficiencies are considerable, with just a single percentage saving in fuel enabling savings of tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Controlling air levels just above the point at which incomplete combustion starts also enables the "cleanest burn," helping plants meet environmental emissions requirements. This in particular reduces the emission of NOx.
 
TDLS technology reduces the burden on operator competence and the potential for human error by delivering the most trustworthy data on the entire furnace as quickly as possible for optimal asset efficiency and safety.
 
The ammonia (NH3) gas is injected to remove the NOx and thus reduce the NOx concentration in the stack flue gas. With conventional NH3 analyzers that perform measurements indirectly, NH3 concentrations are obtained through a sampling system. Therefore, there are problems with the maintenance and running costs of the sampling system, and time delays in measurement. The TDLS8000 Laser Analyzer is the solution to all these problems.
 
In maintaining and managing industrial plants, monitoring waste water pH/ORP is both a legal obligation and an unavoidable necessity for protecting the environment. Monitoring without an attentive eye can lead to severe consequences.
 
Considering safety and environmental issues such as combustion efficiency and decreasing NOX and CO in exhaust gas, it has become important to control O2 concentration in garbage incineration processes.
 
In recent years, shale gas extraction technology has made rapid progress, inducing a shale gas revolution mainly in the USA. Thus, the need for analysis of hydrocarbon gases, including natural gas, is expected to grow rapidly. Traditionally gas chromatography has been used for the analysis of hydrocarbon gases; it can accurately measure the concentration of each hydrocarbon component in a sample of natural gas.
 
With fired heaters, users hope to get greater efficiency and reduced emissions
