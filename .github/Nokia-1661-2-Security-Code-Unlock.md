Woo hoo I just had a second near phone death experience. I'd had the same security code problem and ended up getting another Nokia 1661 and moving my sim card over to that. Fine. Then tonight I extremely impatiently and stupidly tried to add something to my reminder list while the phone was on the charger and IT ASKED FOR A SECURITY CODE!!!! My life flashed before my eyes until I remembered the 12345 code. Since it had just happened, the crops were saved. Hope this may be of use to someone before it's too late. SO customer service told me inadvertently locked phones happen a lot.

Meaning to turn off the phone, take out the battery, wait 15mins. Put in the battery, wait 15mins, then turn on the phone for 15 mins. Then eventually the code 12345 will work. I did that for the entire afternoon and finally got it to unlock.
 
Today another scary "defect" showed up. The phone was reporting NO SIM CARD. I restarted the phone a few times and finally it was able to detect the sim card, but all my phone settings including time and date were wiped.
 
I also had this problem last weekend, while recharging my phone. It just locked up! Fortunately, the security code worked (after a while) but all my lists were gone and my preferences had to be reset (the SO Cust. Rep. asked if I had the 1661 as this model seemed to be prone to this problem)
Then, while trying to set my ring tones, I kept getting a prompt for the security code! I was advised to restore the factory defaults.
 
A similar thing just happened to me. I used the phone yesterday and shut if off for the night, but when I tried turning it back on today the phone (Nokia 1661) would not respond at all -- just a black screen. I had to remove the battery, re-insert the battery, and then the phone would turn on; however, I was then prompted for a security code. 1-2-3-4-5 did the trick, but now all of my settings are gone. I also can no longer select a new ringtone. When I try, the phone turns off, turns back on, and I need to re-enter the security code again. I got the phone free when I purchased a $100 airtime voucher, so I really shouldn't complain -- but c'mon... ... ... If the phone has this kind of widespead malfuction, you'd think Nokia would recall all of them.
 
I was having this issue happen to me about once per month. I also had a problem where the phone would stop ringing. It was getting really annoying, so I sent it back to Nokia for warranty service. They updated the software and returned it. Since the update I have not had a problem.
 
For some reason the phone ask me to enter security code every time i turn it on, and all the call history information are erased. Also I have been wondering why I missed so many calls in the past few weeks - perhaps it was because the phone wasn't even ringing. It seems that there are a lot of problems with this phone.

...i've been using this nokia 1661 for 11 months(start feb2010 and going), so far no problem and then
one day, when i check to see if i have some messages on my phone, the screen asked for a "security code" and what can i say, i entered 1234, did not work, i entered my PIN, also did not work. i entered a lot of number and other combination i know off. all did not work. since you can just plug in some number, i just keep on plugging. no maximum limit of try anyway. then i gave up. this phone is bricked i assume. so i googled some info about this and it seems, this is a common problem for this (sorry) crappy but goody cheap nokia 1661 phone.
 
my first try actually did not work. what i did is that i removed the battery from the phone for one night. then i put back the battery, and when it asked for security code, i entered, 12345 = does not work. so i review again what possibly did i miss on this forum. and this is what i did miss (from nancams post):
 
so it did work. after waiting for about 20 minutes i put on 12345 and now i am IN.
i turned off my phone. turn it again, and it asked again a security code. i put 12345 and i am in.
i then set the security level (from the phone settings) to off so i dont need to plug that 12345 everytime i turn it on. so far so good, im back on using my old phone. so what basically happened on my phone after this "security code" brohaha?
 
Really this blog helped...i faced this issue..when i am out of my country...so was about buy new mobile..but this switch off - remove battery - 15 minutes - keep battery just switch on - 15 minutes - then enter 12345...worked..thanks alot to all
 
O celular Nokia 1661 possui um BUG, reportado por vrias pessoas na internet, que ativa o cdigo de segurana do aparelho. Ento ao ligar o aparelho voc precisa entrar com este cdigo (que no o cdigo PIN do seu chip). O cdigo padro dele o 12345, mas se voc entrar com algum outro cdigo antes deste, ele no mais aceitar o cdigo 12345.

Como vc consegui Ricardo? Eu tb tenho um Nokia 7100s-2 e segui todos os passos que o Acassis recomendou para resetar o cod de segurana, mas no deu certo. Tentei duas vezes, a primeira com a tela abaixada e depois com o teclado a mostra, mas no funcionou em ambas! Continuo em busca de uma soluo para resolver esse problema. ?
 
Oi Wesley,
Como este aparelho um celular simples (feature phone) voc s deve conseguir instalar mais toques musicais com o cabo de dados. Nos Nokia mais antigos (ex. 3310) tinha o compositor de msicas (Composer), ento voc conseguia criar outros toques musicais. Talvez voc consiga enviar uma mensagem multimedia (MMS) de outro celular para ele com o toque musical e salvar na memria interna, mas nunca fiz isso, ento no sei de vai funcionar. []s Alan
 
Oi Patricia,
pode ser que a Nokia tenha atualizado o firmware do seu celular e assim ele no permita este tipo de desbloqueio ou, talvez, voc esteja executando alguma etapa de forma incorreta. Siga rigorosamente os passos descritos neste post. Ele funcionou para todos que tinham um Nokia 1661-2 e at para alguns outros modelos de Nokia que usam o mesmo tipo de firmware. Boa sorte, abraos, Alan
 
Meu celular um nokia asha 310, troquei a senha de segurana e no me lembro mais qual coloquei, preciso resetar meu celular como o de fbrica, o que fao para descobrir a senha ou voltar a senha original ?
 
Bom dia Paulo,
creio que esta dica talvez possa te ajudar: -forgotten-nokia-security-code/ Neste site ensina como voc pode segurar uma combinao de teclas para formatar o celular. Mas ateno: voc perder todos os dados que estiverem no celular, a no ser que voc consiga fazer um backup antes via cabo de dados.
 
Ol.. Obrigada pelo post.. no era pra mudar exatamente o cdigo.. mas me ajudou a resolver um problema no mesmo celular .. estava com a tela branca, do nada.. fiz o procedimento.. de restirar a bateria e ficar pressionando a tecla de power por uns 15 segundos .. depois coloquei a bateria .. e voltou a funcionar.. saiu da tela em branco.. muito obrigada mesmo.. um abrao.
