Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of *Dracula* (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, slasher films, splatter films, supernatural horror and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, Italy and Thailand, among other countries.

Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons.
 
*The Dictionary of Film Studies* defines the horror film as representing "disturbing and dark subject matter, seeking to elicit responses of fear, terror, disgust, shock, suspense, and, of course, horror from their viewers."[2] In the chapter "The American Nightmare: Horror in the 70s" from *Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan* (2002), film critic Robin Wood declared that commonality between horror films are that "normality is threatened by the monster."[3] This was further expanded upon by *The Philosophy of Horror, or Parodoxes of the Heart* by Nol Carroll who added that "repulsion must be pleasurable, as evidenced by the genre's popularity."[3]
 
Prior to the release of *Dracula* (1931), historian Gary Don Rhodes explained that the idea and terminology of horror film did not exist yet as a codified genre, although critics used the term "horror" to describe films in reviews prior to *Dracula*'s release.[4] "Horror" was a term used to describe a variety of meanings. In 1913, *Moving Picture World* defined "horrors" as showcasing "striped convicts, murderous Indians, grinning 'black-handers', homicidal drunkards"[5] Some titles that suggest horror such as *The Hand of Horror* (1914) was a melodrama about a thief who steals from his own sister.[5] During the silent era, the term horror was used to describe everything from "battle scenes" in war films to tales of drug addiction.[6] Rhodes concluded that the term "horror film" or "horror movie" was not used in early cinema.[7]
 
Various writings on genre from Altman, Lawrence Alloway (*Violent America: The Movies 1946-1964* (1971)) and Peter Hutchings (*Approaches to Popular Film* (1995)) implied it easier to view films as cycles opposed to genres, suggesting the slasher film viewed as a cycle would place it in terms of how the film industry was economically and production wise, the personnel involved in their respective eras, and how the films were marketed exhibited and distributed.[11]Mark Jancovich in an essay declared that "there is no simple 'collective belief' as to what constitutes the horror genre" between both fans and critics of the genre.[12] Jancovich found that disagreements existed from audiences who wanted to distinguish themselves. This ranged from fans of different genres who may view a film like *Alien* (1979) as belonging to science fiction, and horror fan bases dismissing it as being inauthentic to either genre.[13] Further debates exist among fans of the genre with personal definitions of "true" horror films, such as fans who embrace cult figures like Freddy Kruger of the *A Nightmare on Elm Street* series, while others disassociate themselves from characters and series and focusing on genre *auteur* directors like Dario Argento, while others fans would deem Argento's films as too mainstream, having preferences more underground films.[14] Andrew Tudor wrote in *Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie* suggested that "Genre is what we collectively believe it to be"[15]

The jump scare is a horror film trope, where an abrupt change in image accompanied with a loud sound intends to surprise the viewer.[16] This can also be subverted to create tension, where an audience may feel more unease and discomfort by anticipating a jump scare.[16]
 
Mirrors are often used in horror films is to create visual depth and build tension. Shelton argues mirrors have been used so frequently in horror films that audiences have been conditioned to fear them, and subverting audience expectations of a jump scare in a mirror can further build tension.[16] Tight framing and close-ups are also commonly used; these can build tension and induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see beyond what is around the protagonist.[16]
 
Music is a key component of horror films. In *Music in the Horror Film* (2010), Lerner writes "music in horror film frequently makes us feel threatened and uncomfortable" and intends to intensify the atmosphere created in imagery and themes. Dissonance, atonality and experiments with timbre are typical characteristics used by composers in horror film music.[17]
 
In the book *Dark Dreams*, author Charles Derry conceived horror films as focusing on three broad themes: the horror of personality, horror of Armageddon and the horror of the demonic.[18] The horror of personality derives from monsters being at the centre of the plot, such Frankenstein's monster whose psychology makes them perform unspeakable horrific acts ranging from rapes, mutilations and sadistic killings.[18] Other key works of this form are Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho,* which feature psychotic murderers without the make-up of a monster.[18] The second 'Armageddon' group delves on the fear of large-scale destruction, which ranges from science fiction works but also of natural events, such as Hitchcock's *The Birds* (1963).[18] The last group of the "Fear of the Demonic" features graphic accounts of satanic rites, witchcraft, exorcisms outside traditional forms of worship, as seen in films like *The Exorcist* (1973) or *The Omen* (1976).[19]
 
Some critics have suggested horror films can be a vessel for exploring contemporary cultural, political and social trends. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements.[20] The use of horror films can help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to depict the horrors of the Vietnam War, the Holocaust, the worldwide AIDS epidemic[21] or post-9/11 pessimism.[22] In many occurrences, the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate,[*according to whom?*] yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life.[*clarification needed*][23]
 
The history of horror films was described by author Siegbert Solomon Prawer as difficult to read as a linear historical path, with the genre changing throughout the decades, based on the state of cinema, audience tastes and contemporary world events.
 
Films prior to the 1930s, such as early German expressionist cinema and trick films, have been retrospectively described as horror films as the genre did not become a codified genre until the release of *Dracula* (1931). *Dracula* was a box office success, leading to Universal and several other American film studios to develop and popularise horror films well into the 1940s. By the 1950s, horror would often be made with science fiction themes, and towards the end of the decade horror was a more common genre of international productions.
 
The 1960s saw further developments, with material based on contemporary works instead of classical literature. The release of films like *Psycho,* *Black Sunday* and *Night of the Living Dead* led to an increase of violence and erotic scenes within the genre. The 1970s would expand on these themes with films that would delve into gorier pictures, as well as films that were near or straight pornographic hybrids. Genre cycles in this era include the natural horror film, and the rise of slasher films which would expand in the early 1980s. Towards the 1990s, postmodernism entered horror, while some of the biggest hits of the decade included films from Japan with the success of *Ring* (1998).
 
A genre that emerged in the 1970s, body horror films focus on the process of a bodily transformation. In these films, the body is either engulfed by some larger process or heading towards fragmentation and collapse.[25][26] In these films, the focus can be on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being overtaken, but the focus is generally upon an individual and their sense of identity, primarily them watching their own body change.[25] The earliest appearance of the sub-genre was the work of director David Cronenberg, specifically with early films like *Shivers* (1975).[25][26] Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion, but also pleasure and excitement such as in *The Thing* (1982) and *The Fly* (1986).[27]
 
Erotic horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that blends sensual and sexual imagery with horrific themes for the sake of sexual arousal. Erotic horror has had influences on French[32] and American horror cinema. The works of Jean Rollin, such as *Le Viol du Vampire* and *Fascination*, are considered quintessential erotic horror films, blending deeply sexual imagery with gore.[32] American cinema has also featured notable erotic horror film franchises, such as *Candyman.*[33] An example of a British erotic horror film series is *Hellraiser*.[34] *Alien* features heavy erotic imagery, with the design of the Xenomorph by H. R. Giger featuring both phallic and vaginal imagery, intended to symboliz
