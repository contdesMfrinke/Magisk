I think that is a normal procedure for them. When i first tried tutanota almost a year ago and signed up without any vpn or tor, I received similar pop-up like you and within 48 hours, i was able to send & receive emails without any problems without doing a single thing. I think you should just wait for one or two days, it will automatically resolved. By the way, recently I created account on tuta and i faced problems while registering.
