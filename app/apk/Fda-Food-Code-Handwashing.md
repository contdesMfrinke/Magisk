(b) Food employees shall use utensils, including scoops, forks, tongs, paper wrappers, gloves, or other implements, to assemble ready-to-eat food or to place ready-to-eat on tableware or in other containers. However, food employees may assemble or place on tableware or in other containers ready-to-eat food in an approved food preparation area without using utensils if hands are cleaned in accordance with Section 113953.3.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2019, the Minnesota food code will no longer require nail brushes at handwashing sinks. Also, heated-air and air-knife hand dryers are now allowed at handwashing sinks in the kitchen.
 
After Jan. 1, operators will no longer be required to provide or maintain nail brushes at handwashing sinks. New technology dries hands safely; hand dryers or individual disposable towels both get the job done, when used properly.
 
There are several options for drying hands at a handwashing sink, including individual, disposable towels; heated-air hand dryer; hand dryer with an air-knife system that delivers high velocity, pressurized air; and continuous towel system that supplies the user with a clean towel.

On October 20, 1999, the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) published a final rulemaking in the Federal Register that establishes regulatory sanitation performance standards applicable to all official meat and poultry establishments. (FSIS Docket 96-037F; 64 FR 56400) Performance standards set forth requirements in terms of an objective to be achieved, but do not prescribe the means to achieve that objective. Therefore, to meet the sanitation performance standards, establishments may develop and employ sanitation or processing procedures customized to the nature and volume of their production.
 
In this document, FSIS presents or references methods already proven to be effective in maintaining sanitary conditions in meat and poultry establishments. Past FSIS regulations and guidance, as well as recommendations from the 1999 Food Code and other technical sources, are included or cited. Establishments that follow the guidance in this document can be fairly certain that they are meeting the sanitation performance standards. Establishments should keep in mind, however, that each processing environment is unique and that in some cases, the methods presented in this document may be inadequate to ensure sanitary conditions or prevent the adulteration of meat and poultry products.
 
Establishments in compliance with past FSIS requirements may not want to change their procedures for maintaining sanitation. Such establishments may use this document as a reference, as it contains the past regulatory requirements governing sanitation (in the Appendix 1), as well as other guidance. Establishments that choose to innovate or customize their sanitation procedures also may find this document useful as a starting point for designing their new sanitation procedures.
 
Relevant recommendations from the 1999 Food Code; we are including only sections that seem most applicable to most meat and poultry establishments; many establishments likely will find additional useful information in the Food Code that is not presented here
 
Finally, the specific sanitary practices described in this document **are not requirements**. Establishments must comply with the regulatory performance standards for sanitation cited below, but may do so by whatever means they determine to be appropriate. FSIS inspection personnel will verify that official establishments comply with the performance standards, regardless of whether the establishments follow the guidance in this document
 
The 1999 Food Code, published by the Food and Drug Administration, is a reference document for regulatory agencies responsible for overseeing food safety in retail outlets such as restaurants and grocery stores and institutions such as nursing homes and child care centers. It is neither federal law nor federal regulation and is not preemptive, but may be adopted and used by agencies at all levels of government that have responsibility for managing food safety risks at retail. Although the Food Code specifically addresses retail and institutional food service operations, many of its recommendations are applicable to official meat and poultry establishments.
 
You also can purchase printed copies and CD-ROM and computer diskette versions of the 1999 Food Code from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). You can order from NTIS on the Internet at: or by mail from:
 
In this guide, FSIS cites construction, plumbing, and sewage disposal guidance, standards, and codes developed other Federal agencies and by private standards organizations. FSIS does not require compliance with any of the private organizations' standards or codes and does not specifically endorse their use. However, these standards and codes provide useful information concerning construction, plumbing, and sewage disposal and, in many cases, compliance with them by meat and poultry establishments can ensure compliance with the sanitation performance standard regulations. Establishments, of course, may use other codes or information and should always comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws governing construction, plumbing, and sewage disposal. FSIS plans to reference additional codes and standards, as appropriate, in future versions of this compliance guide.
 
If the desired information cannot be found within the Compliance Guideline, FSIS recommends that users search the publicly posted Questions & Answers (Q&As) in the askFSIS knowledgebase or submit questions through askFSIS. Documenting these questions helps FSIS improve and refine present and future versions of the Compliance Guideline and associated issuances.

Proper sanitation is a fundamental requirement under both the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA). Meat and poultry products produced, packed, or held under insanitary conditions, where they may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health, are adulterated.
 
**Grounds and pest control.** The grounds about an establishment must be maintained to prevent conditions that could lead to insanitary conditions, adulteration of product, or interfere with inspection by FSIS personnel. Establishments must have in place a pest management program to prevent the harborage and breedi
