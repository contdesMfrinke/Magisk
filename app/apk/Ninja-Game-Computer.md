Students are invited to participate in the study sessions to prepare for quizzes, to discuss programming concepts, and to get upbeat assistance while working on weekly laboratory assignments. Our CS mentoring team is dedicated to helping students (especially those who have no prior knowledge of computer science) develop excellent problem-solving and programming skills in a friendly, confidence-building environment. In order to fuel this project, snacks are provided at ninja sessions.
 
Lauri Courtenay, our Academic Support Coordinator and ninja wrangler, also serves as a mentor. She welcomes the opportunity to discuss CS and life with students and future students! Please contact her at lauri at cs.swarthmore.edu or 957-6062.

When the ninjas are not in the lab you will find them across campus singing in a capella groups, swimming or playing soccer, tennis and squash, working on biology and engineering projects, listening to music or playing violin or piano, learning new languages, backpacking, sailing, improvising, robotics, hiking, Aikido, cooking and writing poetry. Our motto: Everything's better with ninjas!
 
Hello. I am having an issue where I can import any number of Prores files into Premier 2019 once but if I try to import the same or other files after that all I get is the audio track. These files are 4k files from a Sony a7iii recorded using Prores 422 on an Atomos Ninja 5 recorder. I have created a new empty project for this. I am using Windows 10
 
Most times I totally wipe the ninja drive ( move files, rather than copy). When I put the SSD back into ninja I FORMAT IT. Cause weird things happen sometimes when I just CONNECT that SSD to the computer.
 
1. I have an a7iii as well and each time I import the ninja v (pro res LT) files and drag them into the bottom of the project bin (new item) just to see if they'll create a pro res sequence...it defaults to a DNX-HD sequence. (I guess premiere does not recognize pro res as a native editing codec) I guess apple keeps that for Final Cut. Yes, I can export pro res and have always been able to do this with Mac. Now they just made that possible for Windows.
 
2. Aside from the above, I don't seem to be able to record other flavors/resolutions on the Ninja V. I've spoken to Atomos support and we've gone through the settings but each time I plug the Ninja V...it defaults to UHD. I'm curious whether you've tried to record (output) 1080/30/24p from the Sony? If you've done so successfully, please let me know what camera settings you used?
 
I have not tried this system-ninja program but it makes me feel even better about getting the CCleanerEnhancer to know that the author has such a knowledge of cleaning programs that he has even made his own.
 
1 Why should someone have CCleaner + CCEhancer, and then get System Ninja, how do they relate to each other. Perhaps it would be useful to explain this in your program description. At present I use CCleaner + IOBit ASC.

Thanks for your concise answer to my questions 09-09-10, you are a born technical writer. I put another question under CCEnhancer, but I cannot get to the comments page, to read your answer, so I apologize for that.
 
I would really like to gain an overall understanding of NET FRAMEWORK to be able to better use it, so as you are conversant with it, I would be very grateful if you would email me some info and links. Here are some details to save you time :-
 
7 From your 09-09-10 reply, am I correct in thinking :- If Net Framework is installed in XP, it sits there doing nothing in the C drive, unless a program requires some of its dependencies, in which case only those dependencies will be loaded into ram to run.
 
This would ultimately be counter productive, firstly because you should be doing routine disk image backups anyway and secondly because after several cleans it would actually be creating more junk than it is removing.
 
The weird part is this issue is only appearing if I attempt to build/deploy models (via the Edge Impulse Wrapper sample provided with nRF) that are computer vision based - the Continuous Motion model works just fine. Thanks for any help.

Discovered by Jakub Kroustek and belonging to the Dharma/Crysis malware family, Ninja is a malicious program classified as ransomware. Ninja operates by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments for decryption.
 
The text file contains a message stating that all data has been locked and, if users wish to retrieve it, they must send a message to Ninja's developers. The pop-up window is a more detailed ransom message. It informs victims of the encryption and instructs them that, if they wish to decrypt their data, they must use the email addresses listed.
 
If the cyber criminals do not reply within 24 hours, an alternative email address is provided. The victims's message must contain the ID (provided within the filename of each encrypted file and in the pop-up message) in the title/subject field.
 
The cost of decryption tools/software (ransom) is not stated, however, this will supposedly depend on how quickly the victim establishes contact. The Bitcoin cryptocurrency is often stipulated by criminals for payments to be made. For this purpose, links are given, which include instructions about how to acquire Bitcoins.
 
After the ransom is paid, users are promised decryption tools, which will apparently restore their data. As 'proof' that data recovery is possible, free decryption of one file is offered. This test file must not exceed 1 MB and contain no valuable information (e.g. databases, backups, large excel sheets, etc.).
 
The message concludes with various warnings, which alert the victim that renaming the encrypted files and manual decryption with third party software will result in permanent data loss. Unfortunately, in most cases of ransomware infections, manual decryption is impossible.
 
Typically, only the program used to encrypt the files can decode them. Despite this, you are strongly advised against communicating with and/or meeting the demands of cyber criminals. Although some victims pay, they receive none of the necessary tools/software and their data remains essentially useless.
 
While removing Ninja will not restore affected files, it will prevent further encryption. The only solution is to recover the data from a backup, if one was made prior to the attack and was stored separately.
 
Peet, Major, 2Hamlampampom, and M3g4c0rtx are just some examples of other malware infections similar to Ninja. All ransomware is designed to encrypt data and demand payment for decryption tools/software. Crucial differences include the cryptographic algorithm they use (symmetric or asymmetric) and the ransom size.
