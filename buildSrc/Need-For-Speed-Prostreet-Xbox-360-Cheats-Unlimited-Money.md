**Cheat Codes**  
  
From the list of Cheat Codes below the most important one is UNLOCKALLTHINGS. These cheat codes are disabled by the game update. To use these codes you will have to clear the system cache of your Xbox 360. Once you have used the cheat codes you have to save your game. Then you can continue to play online with your "cheated" save game.

To enter the cheats go into career mode and select "code entry." You need to have beaten the initial introduction event to gain the ability to do this.  
  
NOTE: You cannot use the cheats on a save game made with the update. This means you have to use the codes on a new save. You have to decide if you want to use the cheats when you start playing the game.
 
**Clear System Cache on the Xbox 360**  
  
Clearing the cache on the Xbox 360 is useful if the system seems sluggish, unresponsive, or you just need to get rid of a game update. All downloaded game updates will be removed. If you have downloaded an update for a game, in order to play it on Xbox Live you will need to download it again. User game saves, profiles, demos, videos, etc. are not deleted during the process.  
  
To clear the cache on the Xbox 360 do the following:
 
Money trick 1. Enter the code LEPZIG in the cheats entry, which will enable you to purchase the Acura Integra for free. Buy the free car in the car lot (Acura Integra) and sell it for 7.000 credits. Repeat this until you have enough money. You can buy multiple instances of this car and sell them all. Even so this will take a long time because you want enough money to buy cars and all upgrade parts. Speed up the money trick by using the Zonda car. The Zonda car is a DLC car.
 
Money trick 2. Enter the code "unlockallthings" and turn off autosave. Then complete one race. Return to the garage and there will be some new cars. Sell these for 71,000 and manually save the game. Reset your console and restart the game and you will be able to repeat the trick.
 
**\***By entering the **UNLOCKALLTHINGS**cheat you can earn several achievements. If you join a race day after entering the cheat and leave the event afterwards you will unlock the following achievements.
