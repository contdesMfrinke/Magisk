This section lists all the places where enemies can appear in a perceived randomised way. This includes encounters where the type of enemy that appears is randomly different, or new enemies will suddenly appear in areas that were empty beforehand. This list does not contain enemies you are guaranteed to encounter during every playthrough, unless the circumstances in which they appear are worth mentioning.

The first time you explore the residential street you will first hear, and then find, a man being attacked on the west side of the area. If you wait around in the area for roughly one or two minutes, then the attacked man will rise up as zombie himself. Alternatively if you exit the area before he turns, immediately re-entering the street is enough time for the man to have become a zombie too.
 
The first time you revisit the business main street at any point in the game you can witness a woman being chased by zombies. You must enter the street via one of the doors on the west side to see this. If you enter the street via the east door (from the back street), or if you follow the woman around to the east side of the street, you will hear her scream. If after seeing the girl or hear her scream you exit the business main street and re-enter it through one of the doors on the west side, a zombie will burst out of the car as you pass by it.

To trigger this appearance of this zombie you need to have already performed the criteria that causes the uptown business street car zombie to appear. Once that has been done, visit the back alleyway outside the warehouse and you will find the dead body of the girl and the zombie that killed her.
 
After visiting the bar and meeting Brad, these zombies will appear once you have navigated at least two zones away. So provided you go and explore the business main street, the business back street or the barricaded back street, when you return you will find that three zombies now occupy the bar.
 
If you return here much later in the game and you did not kill all three of the zombies, then you will find that magically only one zombie will appear. This scenario only occurs however if you have acquired the oil additive and you have encountered Nemesis at the uptown forked alley.
 
Once you have been introduced to the Drain Deimos in the downtown maintenance area, if you return to the uptown zigzag alley you will find that either Drain Deimos or Brain Suckers have infested the area.
 
Once you have met Carlos in person at either the restaurant or the press office, if you return to the downtown maintenance area you will find that enemies have respawned here in the form of Drain Deimos or Brain Suckers.
 
Visiting the shopping district without first meeting Carlos in person means there will be 6 zombies wandering around. If you then trigger the criteria to meet Carlos inside the restaurant and end up exiting via the basement ventilation shaft, then the ensuing cut-scene will end with two zombies interrupting your conversation. If you killed at least two zombies before meeting Carlos in the restaurant then an additional two will spawn from this cut-scene. But only a maximum of six zombies will ever appear in the shopping district, so this means that a total of eight zombies can technically spawn over the course of these events.
 
The first time you visit the downtown dirty alley there will either be four zombies, and they'll all be playing dead throughout the area, or there will be five zombies and they'll either be crawling around or eating a dead body.
 
Once you have met Nicholai at the cable car (it is not necessary to meet Carlos there to trigger this specific encounter) then as you approach the green door in the south west section of the three points street, the door will burst open and four zombies will emerge.
 
After triggering the zombies to burst through the green door, provided you kill all of these zombies, when you re-enter this area then zombies will burst from the windows lining the south west section of the street.
 
Once you have met Carlos at the cable car, and provided you have not yet met Nicholai at the gas station, then zombies will have spawned in the construction street. If you have already visited the gas station and happened to have met Nicholai there, then different enemies will occupy the street.
 
Provided you have met the criteria for spawning zombies in the construction street then there is chance that an additional zombie will burst from the car parked in the south east corner of the street. However, if you have met the criteria for spawning the alternative enemies in the street then this zombie will never emerge.
 
The construction street will spawn non-zombie enemies under quite specific circumstances. If you visit the gas station and Nicholai arrives, then either Drain Deimos or Brain Suckers will replace the zombies in the construction street. The arrival of these enemies also means that the zombie (if it hasn't already done so) will never burst from the car.
 
Once you have met Carlos at the cable car, when you return to the parking area then crows will burst through the windows of the bus wreckage spanning the west side of the area. However, the exact moment this occurs is random. If the crows do not burst out of the windows the first time navigating from the garage towards the straight alleyway, then they will not appear until after you have acquired the oil additive and as you make your way back towards the cable car.
 
The final enemies to spawn in the uptown residential street are triggered under quite specific circumstances. If you return here after acquiring the oil additive, and only if you encountered Nemesis at the forked alley, then either zombies or a zombie dog will spawn in the street. If you have acquired the oil but encountered Nemesis at the sub station instead, then these enemies will not spawn at all.
 
After acquiring the oil additive you will face a live selection inside the garage and nearly fall through a hole in the floor. If you choose to drop down into the hole, you will find sliding worms populate this small underground area. It's worth noting that even if you kill all these worms, if you re-enter the location you will find they have respawned and will keep respawning indefinitely.
 
The enemies that will appear here will differ depending on some circumstances. If you chose to jump out of the window of the cable car live selection, then crows will always appear in this location. However if you did not do this, then either crows or zombie dogs will appear.
 
Zombies will burst through the windows of the piano room after visiting the chapel. It's worth noting that it is not necessary to pick up anything inside that room, all you need to do is navigate as far as its western side and that is the condition needed to trigger this zombie appearance.
 
If you chose to jump out of the window of the cable car live selection, then no enemies will spawn in this location for Jill because she ends up meeting Carlos here instead of in the dining room. But if you did not jump out of the window, then either small spiders or zombies will occupy this room.
 
If you chose to not jump out of the window of the cable car live selection, then no enemies will spawn in this location for Jill because she ends up meeting Carlos here instead of in the small library. But if you did jump out of the window, then either zombies, Drain Deimos or Brain Suckers will occupy this room.
 
The bedroom of the clock tower will always contain four zombies, but their appearance is triggered by different circumstances. If you chose to jump out of the window of the cable car live selection then these zombies will emerge from the cable car wreckage as you approach the western door out of the room. If however you did not jump out of the cable car window, you first need to explore the area of the wreckage before returning to the door to trigger the emergence of the zombies.
 
When playing as Carlos you will find that this location is empty if Jill did not jump out of the cable car window during the live selection. The only caveat to this specific rule is if, as Jill, you did not kill every enemy that spawned here (detailed above) then these will remain for Carlos to tackle.
 
When playing as Carlos you will find that either zombies or zombie dogs now occupy the bedroom. It's worth noting that even though all of the enemies that Carlos encounters on his mission to acquire the vaccine will disappear once this mission is accomplished, these enemies will remain here once you have regained control of Jill.
 
When playing as Carlos you will find that the clock room is initially devoid of any enemies. But once you have specifically entered the hospital waiting room, this room becomes occupied with either zombies or sliding worms.
 
When playing as Carlos, there are initially zombies wandering around the alleyway outside the hospital. However, once you have specifically entered the hospital reception office then these zombies will disappear and be replaced with Hunter Betas. These Hunters will disappear though once you have acquired the vaccine medium and the vaccine base.
 
When exploring the hospital as Carlos, it is necessary to use the elevator to navigate between the three accessible floors. However, disembarking the elevator will randomly yield a swarm of zombies in one of these three locations.
 
When exploring the hospital as Carlos, where you meet Tyrell will determine where you encounter Hunters later on. If you trigger the cut-scene with you encountering Tyrell inside the data room on the fourth floor, next time you visit the basement storeroom you will find that Hunters now occupy this location (even if you visited it beforehand and seen that it was empty). Similarly, if you do the opposite and
