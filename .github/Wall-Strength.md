The spatial distributions of both wall stress and wall strength are required to accurately evaluate the rupture potential for an individual abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The purpose of this study was to develop a statistical model to non-invasively estimate the distribution of AAA wall strength. Seven parameters--namely age, gender, family history of AAA, smoking status, AAA size, local diameter, and local intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness--were either directly measured or recorded from the patients hospital chart. Wall strength values corresponding to these predictor variables were calculated from the tensile testing of surgically procured AAA wall specimens. Backwards-stepwise regression techniques were used to identify and eliminate insignificant predictors for wall strength. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to derive a final statistical model for AAA wall strength, from which 95% confidence intervals on the model parameters were formed. The final statistical model for AAA wall strength consisted of the following variables: sex, family history, ILT thickness, and normalized transverse diameter. Demonstrative application of the model revealed a unique, complex wall strength distribution, with strength values ranging from 56 N/cm2 to 133 N/cm2. A four-parameter statistical model for the noninvasive estimation of patient-specific AAA wall strength distribution has been successfully developed. The currently developed model represents a first attempt towards the noninvasive assessment of AAA wall strength. Coupling this model with our stress analysis technique may provide a more accurate means to estimate patient-specific rupture potential of AAA.

The wall strength of a shipping container is determined by the thickness and quality of the steel used, as well as the design and construction of the container. It is also important to consider factors such as corrosion resistance and impact resistance when assessing wall strength.
 
The average wall strength of a shipping container varies depending on the size and type of container. However, most shipping containers have a wall thickness of around 2-3 millimeters, which provides sufficient strength to withstand the stresses of transportation and stacking.
 
Yes, the wall strength of a shipping container can be increased through various methods such as adding additional steel reinforcing plates or coatings to improve corrosion resistance. However, these modifications may add to the weight and cost of the container.
 
The wall strength of a shipping container directly impacts its maximum load capacity. A stronger container can withstand heavier loads without risking damage to the walls or compromising the structural integrity of the container. It is important to check the manufacturer's specifications to determine the maximum load capacity for a specific shipping container.
 

Masonry construction involves heavy materials. The weight from these materials leads to certain types of stresses. There are three types of forces that may impact on the construction. The first step to cope with these stresses is to understand the forces involved.

Arguably, although it's a matter of taste, a wall should also be well made so that it looks good. 

**Support Strength**
Walls have to be constructed so that they are thick enough to maintain stresses within safe limits for the compressive stresses on the materials in the wall. Wall thickness to height should prevent buckling of the wall under stress and collapse laterally. The materials used have to be fit for purpose i.e. able to withstand adverse conditions or corrosion from salts and pollution.
 
Cavity walls don't need to be as strong as single layer walls because they gain support from being tied to one another. For very high strength bricks (>70N/mm2) mortar with a 1:3 cement to sand mix should be used. For low strength brickwork, a mix of 1:2:9 (cement to lime to sand) may be used.
 
Building regulations set out permissible height to thickness ratios for walls of buildings (slenderness ratios). These vary according to the material used e.g. clay brick, stone. Construction of smaller buildings and other structures are governed by factors other than strength such as fire resistance and insulation.
 
I run into these things all of the time in new homes. The last house I did had six of them. As long as the top track is level you won't have a problem and make sure the door you hang is not bowed too much ( yeah yeah they're all straight ) I know the wall is weak but so are partition walls with 24" spacing.
 
The only trouble I've seen with a properly installed door was one set into a partition wall in the middle of a joist span. The trouble was, when you walked by the door the floor would sag ever so slightly and the floor brackets would slide on the half studs and squeeeek like heck.
 
Being concerned of the rigidity of the wall, I took a pair of 2x6 and ran it across the top of the door opening and the pocket cavity. (Like a header). Floor to ceiling studs fastened to the 2x6's. I thought it would help secure this cathedral wall as mine is 15 foot long and 12 high at one end. The framing was stiffer with this addition, but still less than a normal stud wall. The drywall was the big change. If you run drywall horizontal, you'll notice, it is stiffer on the long axis. If it really bugs you then go to 5/8ths. You say it is a wet wall in a bathroom then I'd get greenboard or struggle thru the durock panels. All of those can be glued and screwed as well.
 
Key Point here is to glue it in place and screw it to the 1x4's. Be sure not to get too long a screw or you'll mess up your pocket door (cavity). PL400 or some sort of waterproof adhesive for drywall will make it very rigid. Too much glue is good.
 
The 2x4 to block it out will probably work but think about your taping and finishing of that thing. That is probably 3 hours of screwing around in finish work and you'll always look at it and think " sheesh is there another way to do this?"
 
Denshield- I think Georgia Pacific makes it. It wieghs what sheetrock weighs, cuts like sheetrock, (have a nice day cutting a shower valve out in a cloud of dust from your Roto-Zip with Durarock) Anyway, to make a long story longer, the stuff works great in wet environments and is much less of a pain in the behind than Durarock.
 
I just used 5/8" Denshield for the first time to line a pump room in a garage. It's a potentially damp environment and Durock wouldn't pass fire code. My sheetrocker suggested it and apparently it's also used as a sheathing for under Stucco on commercial. The new Wally world Grocery store here was sheathed with it.
 
Saw the ads for the Denshield too late for my recent project. The biggest pain with the durock is the replacement of blades in my knife. You get 5 or 6 cuts and you might as well be using a screwdriver to score the durock. I keep 4 + knives in rotation to make the project go faster.
 
How does the denshield work for flooring backer? It isn't any cheaper but it does come in 4x8 sheets. Right now it is shoulda woulda coulda. All that is left for me is the small piecing & thinset & tile. It is hard to believe an advertiser it is in this forum where the rubber meets the road.
 
I agree, the framing kit is extremely flimsy. Whenever I frame for the installation of a pocket door I sheathe framing (to both sides of wall) with plywood installed horizontilly. This helps alot especially on a long wall where the ply can be staggered and tied into much sounder framing. So long as wall thickness is not an issue I use 3/4" ply before sheetrocking the wall. Just be sure to glue (construction adhesive) and use screws short enough not to extend through framing. Staggering the drywall joints in opposition to the plywood helps to insure rigdidty with less chance of joint cracking. Its a bit more work initially, but it saves much in the long run.
 
I had a recent install of a Johnson pocket door, same flimsy wall studs. I couldn't increase the wall thickness from the existing 4-1/2", so I did a couple of things to improve what I had. I first screwed a 6' piece of 3/4" angle iron to the side of each "stud". I held the pieces above the subfloor by about 6". They helped a good bit. Then I put pieces of 1x6 horizontally between each pair of studs to serve as backing for the base. My other option was to run oak 1x\_ full length vertically between the metal studs. Both the oak & the angle iron were in my shop but I valued the oak more. End result is a wall that's not quite as stiff as conventional framing but is a big improvement over the unimproved version.
 
This discussion precedes my next project, which is to convert a small room off the master bedroom into a walk in closet. The room is 72" deep and 96" wide, with a 70" wide by 80" tall opening into the master BR. The opening is offset from the inner wall by about 3/4". On the outer wall side, there is a full depth bench seat 20" high and 20" deep, which I believe covers up where porch beams tie into the house. The opening is framed with 1x6 trim. My thought at the moment is to pull the trim and install a 36" pocket door in the opening, but one concern is whether I could get a strong enough wall to support a couple of 72" closet hanger rods that would run parallel to the inner wall. There is a window above the bench seat so we really can't put closet rods on the outer wall side. I think the wall I'd be framing in is thick enough where a piece of 3/4" plywood could be put under the drywall, and from what I've read here, this seems desirable anyway if only to stiffen the pocket door
