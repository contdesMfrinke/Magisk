Yes, "Advanced Quantum Physics by Paar" is regularly updated to incorporate the latest advancements in quantum physics. The author, Dr. Paar, is a leading researcher in the field and ensures that the book reflects the current state of the art in quantum physics.
 
As a student you will get acquainted with the theoretical concepts behind quantum technologies and you will apply them in a series of quantum lab courses. You will discuss state-of-the-art research results with your peers and professors. You can absolve even an industrial internship in a high-tech company within your studies. Finally, your master thesis will allow you to work on your own quantum science project, whether theoretical or experimental.
 
Applicants must have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics (or a comparable undergraduate degree) with a German grade of 2.5 or better (or international equivalent). Additionally, students must prove above-average performance in their bachelors degree within the subjects quantum mechanics, atom physics and physics of condensed matter.
 
In the first year the students attend lectures, seminars and practical courses consisting of 60 ECTS credit points. The students take both experimental and theoretical quantum optics, which lays the foundations for all students. These are augmented by a lab course.

In the second term students can choose modules from a variety of different topics. Moreover, the students will learn to discuss problems of quantum science in a comprehensive way both within a journal club where they present a current topic of quantum science, and within a peer-learning seminar where they discuss topics of quantum science in small groups of their peers. For this seminar, they choose three of the modules that they have passed. In the second year the students begin with research on a topic of their choice in the areas of the Center for Quantum Science and finally write their master thesis, all together again 60 CP (30 for acquiring research oriented skills and 30 for the thesis).
 
Students can annualy start their studies in the winter semester. The application perdiod starts at the 1st of March. The application deadline for non-EU students is July 15. For EU applications, it is September 30.

Quantum physics is at the heart of today's technology. Ever smaller devices scratching the size limits of single atoms will increase the importance of quantum physics for technological applications. In this Master program you will gain theoretical understanding and experimental expertise in state-of-the-art quantum physics with emphasis on atomic molecular and optical physics. The physics department is deeply involved into cutting edge research in this field and you will benefit from a close contact between students and researches and from award-winning teaching expertise. All professors are involved in several collaborative research centers in the field of quantum physics.
 
This course will cover advanced topics of quantum mechanics including postulates of quantum mechanics, tools of quantum mechanics, Dirac notation, Simple Harmonic oscillator (studied using raising and lowering operators), orbital and spin angular momentum (studied using raising and lowering operators), Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Density matrix and Schroedinger's cat, Non-locality and Bell's inequalities, Quantum cryptography (distributing secure keys), Basic ideas of Quantum computing (qubits, quantum teleportation). (Last 4 topics non examinable in final assessment, only in the mini-dissertation).
 
Weekly problem sheets will be set, three of which will be assessed with the worst one waived. 1 mini-dissertation on Chapter 6 will be assigned at the end of the last week before the Christmas break with deadline at the end of the week after the Christmas break.
 
This textbook, now in an expanded third edition, emphasizes the importance of advanced quantum mechanics for materials science and all experimental techniques which employ photon absorption, emission, or scattering. Important aspects of introductory quantum mechanics are covered in the first seven chapters to make the subject self-contained and accessible for a wide audience. *Advanced Quantum Mechanics: Materials and Photons* can therefore be used for advanced undergraduate courses and introductory graduate courses which are targeted towards students with diverse academic backgrounds from the Natural Sciences or Engineering. To enhance this inclusive aspect of making the subject as accessible as possible, introductions to Lagrangian mechanics and the covariant formulation of electrodynamics are provided in appendices.
 
This third edition includes 60 new exercises, new and improved illustrations, and new material on interpretations of quantum mechanics. Other special features include an introduction to Lagrangian field theory and an integrated discussion of transition amplitudes with discrete or continuous initial or final states. Once students have acquired an understanding of basic quantum mechanics and classical field theory, canonical field quantization is easy. Furthermore, the integrated discussion of transition amplitudes naturally leads to the notions of transition probabilities, decay rates, absorption cross sections and scattering cross sections, which are important for all experimental techniques that use photon probes.

The assessment strategy is designed to provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to recall and apply the postulates and the methods of quantum mechanics to simple systems. The student will understand how to use operator methods to analyse the simple harmonic oscillator, and angular momentum. The student will be able to represent operators as matrices and use standard matrix methods, for example to compute the eigenvalues and expectation values of operators. The student will also be able to go beyond exact solution methods, and apply approximation methods such as perturbation theory, and variational method to simple systems.

 

Thus, the summative assessment for this module consists of:

 Coursework, which will take about 20 hours of effort, weighted at 30%

 Written 2 hour examination at the end of the semester (70%), with a section A of compulsory questions and a section B with 2 questions chosen from 3. In Part A answer all questions (40 points); In Part B answer two questions out of three (10-points each). If all three questions in Part B are attempted only the best two will be counted.

 

Formative assessment and feedback 

Weekly problem sets are issued during the course, with tutorials scheduled throughout the semester. At least one of these problem sets will be formally marked and handed back to the student with explicit written feedback.

 
The learning and teaching strategy is designed to:

Enable students to understand the physics concepts involved in Quantum Mechanics, how to use mathematical tools to find analytical solutions, and to go beyond these analytical solutions using approximation methods.

The learning and teaching methods include:

During your two-year studies, you will receive support and advice by tutors on a regular basis. The degree will be earned after submitting a written thesis and holding an oral presentation of your findings. Graduates qualify for a PhD in a field of quantum sciences, e.g. in quantum optics, atom physics, quantum information, quantum simulation, quantum communication, quantum computing or quantum metrology. Apart from a career in science and research, graduates will find excellent working conditions in high-tech product development as well as the financial, consulting, and insurance sectors.
 
Tbingen is a great place to study. There are many places to enjoy. The Platanenallee is one of my favorites where I can go, relax and reflect. Also, the university has a lot of international students. I think this is a really important thing, it teaches you about different cultures and how to get along with each other.
