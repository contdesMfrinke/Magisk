In the past few years, however, there has been an excellent collection of books released under the Oxford Masters Series (OMS) umbrella. These books tend to be more pedagogical and conversational, shorter in length and necessarily more modern. They would be much more appropriately described as bedtime reading compared to the counterparts mentioned above. There are a few books from the OMS that I have read from cover to cover, and some where I have just read a few chapters. These include the following titles:
 
Most of us learn in solitude with a good textbook/paper rather than in the classroom, and textbooks like these make it easier to get up to speed. I think that condensed matter physics will have a greater appeal at the undergraduate level in the US and other English-speaking countries due to the clarity of the OMS textbooks. The authors of these books have done a service to our sub-field and I much appreciate their effort. Lastly, the philosophical perspective of condensed matter physics has changed somewhat since the days of Kittel and Ashcroft and Mermin, and our textbooks needed to reflect this overhaul. They can now claim to do this.
 
Please feel free to comment on and recommend books, articles or papers that you found particularly useful. I am curious to know what else is out there, even if not originally an English-language text.
 
I think Oxford solid state is better for undergrads. I also enjoyed QFT for amateurs. In fact, after reading a few chapters I realized that it is well beyond my expectations (i.e. a useful book not only for amateurs). Strongly recommended!
 
I do not have words to appreciate the Stephen Blundell Magnetism, and Statistical mechanics books.
Overall I do agree with you that the Oxford series is very consistent, all the authors have done a great service to society.
Over the years I and my friend has made a list of books which can be a good starting point for beginners( -with-me).

The approach presented in this work allows a consistent calculation of electrical conductivity of dense matter from the solid state to the hot plasma using the same procedure, consisting in dropping elastic scattering contributions to solid's and liquid's structure factors in the framework of the Ziman theory. The solid's structure factor was computed using a multiphonon expansion. The elastic part is the zero-phonon term and corresponds to Bragg peaks, thermally damped by Debye-Waller attenuation factors. For the liquid, a similar elastic contribution to the structure factor results from a long-range order persisting during the characteristic electron-ion scattering time. All the quantities required for the calculation of the resistivities are obtained from our average-atom model, including the total hypernetted-chain structure factor used from the liquid state to the plasma. No interpolation between two limiting structure factors is required. We derive the correction to apply to the resistivity in order to account for the transient long-range order in the liquid and show that it improves considerably the agreement with quantum-molecular dynamics simulations and experimental aluminum's isochoric and isobaric conductivities. Our results suggest that the long-range order in liquid aluminum could be a slightly compressed fcc one. Two series of ultrafast experiments performed on aluminum were also considered, the first one by Milchberg *et al.* using short laser pulses and the second one by Sperling *et al.* involving x-ray heating and carried out on the Linac Coherent Light Source facility. Our attempts to explain the latter assuming an initial liquid state at an ion temperature much smaller than the electron one suggest that the actual initial state before main heating is neither perfectly solid nor a normal liquid.
 
Three possible definitions of the ion charge Z\* within ion-sphere models. Zcont is the number of continuum electrons, Zfree denotes the ideally free electrons alone, and ZWS corresponds to the charge on the Wigner-Seitz sphere. Case of aluminum at solid density.
 
Inelastic structure factor for solid aluminum at T=930 K (i.e., closed to melting). The black curve is obtained applying the Meisel-Cote-Debye approximation [58, 59] taking into account scattering processes involving up to five phonons. The red one corresponds to the simpler Nagel-Einstein one [60].

**Although the Cavendish was founded as a laboratory of experimental physics, it was amongst the first to establsh a dedicated theory group with a focus on the quantum physics of condensed matter. The first 40 years of its history have been documented by Volker Heine, a member of the Cavendish for more than 60 years, and a founding member of the theory group. A different, and narrower, perspective on TCM's history can befound on our page of our computing history.Separately we list particularly eminentalumni.**
 
Nevill Mott was our father. He arrived in 1954 from Bristol as Cavendish Professor, and brought John Ziman in the same year as a new lecturer to start a group on Solid State Theory (or SST for short). Of course the Cavendish had been traditionally the Department of Experimental Physics, with just one or two isolated theoreticians in experimental groups. The main effort in theoretical physics in Cambridge was centred in what is now called the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (or DAMTP), but no one there had any interest in ("microscopic") solid state physics.
 
However, experience before and during World War II, and developments in the USA, had shown Mott the importance of a strong theory group allied to the experimental effort. Furthermore solid state physics was becoming a leading area of research in the Cavendish, with the work of David Shoenberg and Brian Pippard on mapping out the Fermi surfaces of metals for the first time, Pippard introducing the concept of coherence length in superconductivity, David Tabor's work on surface physics, crystallography (including the recent work of Francis Crick and James Watson on DNA), Peter Hirsch turning the electron microscope onto seeing dislocations, and more. So it made sense to start a group on solid state theory in the Cavendish.
 
Mott was Cavendish Professor (1954-71) and was never really part of the theory group, though of course his presence, research interests, visitors, and an occasional student including Nick Rivier (housed within SST) were very important. He was not a "
