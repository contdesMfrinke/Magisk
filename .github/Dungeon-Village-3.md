You must make sure that your town grows and prospers despite these monster attacks, as well as strengthening the adventurers so that they can continue to protect your town.
 
Adventurers act on their own, fighting monsters for a set amount of time (the amount of time dependent on their "work"), and then visit the town after to visit stores and (if they have one) their house. They become more powerful as they level up, change jobs, are given items (by you) or through Events. If adventurers are defeated, they fall unconscious for an amount of time, or until another Adventurer brings them to an Inn, which greatly increases the recovery speed, or revived with a healing spell or player item.

Through Events, clearing dungeons, raising effectiveness of a building past a certain point, and other occurrences, your town starts to gain popularity. Through popularity you gain new adventurers, new events, new monsters, and medals for your adventurers (which can be used at the end of each year to greatly affect their Satisfaction and Work).
 
As you fight monsters, you gain experience, gold (), and also increase the amount of Town Points you get each month. These points are used to host events, unlock new structures, and also change an adventurer's job. You will also be prompted every so often to fight a boss monster. While a boss monster rampages around your town, your town loses popularity, so it is advised to kill it as fast as possible. Once a boss is killed, you are awarded a sizable amount of money and Town Points.
 
Quests (of which boss monsters are one) are the primary way for your adventurers to obtain items and unlock new equipment. Whether on the field or in a dungeon, Red chests contain consumable items, while Blue chests contain equipment that once contained unlock the ability to buy it. While this has potential to earn items, weapons, and even some experience, exploring a dungeon can take up time, and while in a dungeon explorers do not gain money for your village or spend any in town.
 
Consumable items can be either used on a single adventurer for different advantages (such as stat increases), on a building to raise their effects, or put into the Cauldron. The Cauldron is the only way to obtain certain items, weapons, and even buildings.
 
There are up to 25 adventurers you can have in your village, each able to wield weapons/armor and switch jobs. If you level an adventurer all the way up, their job is opened up for others to use as well. If an adventurer moves in, you also get a special reward depending on the adventurer.
 
Structures are one of your most important sources of income in the game. While some buildings allow your adventurers to buy equipment, most simply have a chance to affect your adventurers ' stats, as well as make you money. Structures consist of environment, houses, shops, and eateries.

Structure have an upkeep, which often makes having every structure impractical, although not impossible.You must research structures before using them, and new structures are available for research as your village rank increases.
 
Items can be used to further enhance not only your character, but also to create items and increase the effectiveness of stores. The item shop is restocked every season. Information on creating items through the Cauldron can be found here.
 
Special items can be made in the Cauldron, some not obtainable anywhere else in the game. There are 4 elemental types you use to obtain items. You gain points for these types by adding items to the cauldron. For adding items you get the initial element points (see the Items section for more), but also some extra points over time as they 'simmer' in the cauldron for a few minutes (when the interface is not open), as well as 1 "Knowledge" point for each simmered item (used to unlock more recipes). You can find information pertaining to Equipment and Structures in their respective sections. You can add more items to the cauldron at once through the "Expand Cauldron" 1 / 2 Events, for a total of up to 30 items at once.
 
Events can play a fairly important part in the development of your village. First there's a number of 1-time events for expanding your town and Cauldron, but a number repeatable ones as well. These can raise stats of either all your Adventurers, or the popularity of your village.
 
As mentioned, a big part of Dungeon Village is sending your recruits out into the wild to fend off monsters and complete quests. Their basic ability can be improved as you go along by giving them presents, most of which consist of new weaponry to improve their attack/defend stats. Should they fall during combat, you can quickly heal them with items, but otherwise they might be dragged back to the village to rest, leaving your remaining recruits to fend for themselves.
 
But**Dungeon Village** was on super sale at the Google Play store, and it seems like it should be right up my alley: build up a Japanese RPG village which will house an inn full of heroes. Some of my earliest gaming experiences were with **Dragon Warrior** and **Final Fantasy 1**, the nostalgia of my youth was calling me to a game I could play on my phone in the bathroom.
 
The goal of Dungeon Village is to attract a variety of adventurers to your town so they can defeat monsters in the nearby field and go on quests to find loot for you. Your own town will level up as it reaches goals and be able to expand its land, earn more money, build more shops, and attract more adventurers.
 
Events can be held to boost adventurer or town stats, and weapons and armor can be purchased for anyone at any time to try and balance the odds against the monsters. Adventurer classes can be changed and medals can be awarded for good service at the end of the year. There will sometimes be a godzilla like monster that invades the field which requires immediate attention, but that is the only semblance of a story in Dungeon Village. The graphics are Kairosoft graphics, cute and descriptive.
