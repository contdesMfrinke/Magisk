Various damage settings: depth, scale, roughness, mesh density. Adding deep internal injuries. It is also possible to add reinforced mesh. With these settings, you can perfectly adjust the damage according to your tasks.
 
While all apps have their own detrimental effects, some have proven to be much more harmful to mental health than others. When surveyed, 42.3% of all students interviewed stated that TikTok was the most harmful towards their own mental health.

When asked why, three different effects were brought up the most often: an addictive algorithm that disrupts sleep patterns, popular creators setting extremely unrealistic beauty standards, and the rapid spread of harmful misinformation through viral short videos.
 
Despite criticisms and mentioned negative effects in the previous chapter, just over half (51.9%) of surveyed students said that they still chose to use the social media platform they believe to be the most detrimental to mental health.
 
Other students said they kept the apps simply because it was now mindlessly a part of their routine. While they might prefer to be doing something else, scrolling through social media has become muscle memory to them, and the habit is not easily broken.
 
Whether or not the hassle of regulations and the risk of harm was really worth it was split among students. By the difference of 2 people, it was ultimately more popular to say that social media was worth the consequences (51.9% of voters). Connection was by far the most frequently brought up benefit of social media. The ability to reach almost everyone within a social circle immediately was highly valuable to students. Some students talked about how this ability to connect helped them throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In a time where physical distance was necessary, social media helped to fill the void and close the emotional gap between people.
 
A few surveyed students also stressed the importance of not grouping every social media platform into one category. Platforms like Snapchat and Discord were set aside as programs with much less cons than Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok.
 
If an application's code contains even minor and subtle inaccuracies, it can open up the entire database to SQL injection. In this example (see section 'Delete All Method'), the entire Users table gets deleted with a trivial SQL injection ("1) OR 1=1--").

This had me wondering, have any white hats / bounty hunters (perhaps amateurs) looked for vulnerabilities and accidentally caused massive, real damage to the site/app/business? How do bounty programs deal with such a risk?
 
Sure. As you pointed out, some SQL injection vectors may inadvertently cause data deletion. Similarly, a persistent XSS attack may trigger in the browser of a real user. Or unusual characters in a username may crash a web application backend due to an unhandled encoding error.
 
More generally, a large part of black box pentesting involves experimenting with unexpected/invalid input to the target application. Some level of fuzzing is usually unavoidable - and this always carries the risk of causing behavior that breaks the application or corrupts data. So, while blindly trying out DELETE queries may be reckless and avoidable, vendors have to face that even benign bug hunting occasionally impacts service integrity or availability.
 
This report is an example of where the researcher caused a DOS by submitting invalid data. I'm entirely sure there are more severe examples, many of which simply weren't made public. Anecdotally, I remember several occasions where bug hunters were banned from programs because the tools they used were too disruptive.
 
**A testing environment.** While some bug bounties assume you're testing against production, many provide a separate sandbox and only allow you to test there. E.g., the program of Bitmex includes the rule:
 
**A "responsible research" policy** which asks that hunters make an effort to avoid damage. Rules would include not accessing real user data, limiting automated testing tools, etc. For example, Facebook's program demands:
 
You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) unauthorized access to or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services. You must not intentionally violate any applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized access to data.
 
If you do accidentally cause some noticeable interruption of service, please immediately email us so we can handle it accordingly [email protected] and please include the subject title "HackerOne Outage: " for the alert to trigger.
 
Nowadays, many program policies come with a safe harbor clause. This is intended to protect hunters from liability if they act in good faith, even if their actions have caused damage. Since IANAL, I can't comment on the effectiveness of such a policy, but it's an established practice. Here is an example of a safe harbor clause in the program of Dropbox:
 
Your question appears to assume that the attacker in question is working against a production system. To Fire Quacker's point, if you break someone's production system you're just as liable as any other attacker regardless of your white hat intentions (assuming it is not allowed as a part of a bug bounty program). And this is why bug bounty programs should set up special instances for testing that are not in production.
 
Robust systems should not only resist attacks but demonstrate viable recovery mechanisms. The cost of bugs may be less than bad design. Do you have logs? Can you use them to recover quickly? Production systems may have vulnerabilities like DOS that test systems lack!
 
One day, my dad showed me a tree that had its bark removed and appeared scarred up. He explained it had been done by a bear. I was both amazed and fascinated. From then on, I paid particular attention to bears and the signs they leave behind, and, along with several memorable encounters growing up, I developed a curiosity for bears that continues to this day.
 
After college, I moved to the South Beach area of Grays Harbor County. While on a hunting trip, I began noticing trees with similar damage to those I had seen and learned about back in our woods. The main difference in this case was quantity. I was amazed at how many trees were damaged or dead within this particular area.
 
Flowers has authored several books detailing his adventures as a recreational and professional bear hunter, as well as the history and management of black bear timber damage in working forests throughout western Washington. As I began to read the book, I realized I was not the first to be curious (and in some cases alarmed) at the intensity of tree damage witnessed. The book went on to explain foresters had been documenting and expressing concern over bear damage to young conifer stands in the region for decades.
 
The more I read and experienced first-hand, the more interested I became in forestry and resource management, so much so that I went back to school to study forestry. For the past 6 years, I have been providing technical forestry assistance and helping develop forest management plans for landowners throughout Grays Harbor and Pacific counties.
 
Bears can cause extensive damage within some stands of timber and pose harm to the health of a stand. According to the Washington Forest Protection Association, a single bear can strip bark from as many as 70 trees per day. Damage typically occurs on trees 15-30 years old or with diameters ranging from 6-12 inches.
 
Tree species damaged by bears vary depending on location. In Grays Harbor and Pacific counties, Douglas-fir and western hemlock are preferred species. However, I have seen damage on western red cedar, Sitka spruce, grand fir, subalpine fir, Pacific silver fir, red alder, bigleaf maple, and black cottonwood.
 
Locating bark peels may help signal the presence of damage, even when it is hard to spot. Bark peels tend to be large strips 1 to 3 feet in length and 2 to 4 inches in width. Trees of any age and size are susceptible to bear damage; however, in my experience, bears appear to prefer Douglas-fir and western hemlock over other species. This may be due to the fact that they are more readily available.
 
Sugar concentrations are also an important factor in determining which species are likely to be damaged and when. Out along the coast, we tend to see damage occurring first on western hemlock, then Douglas-fir. This is because western hemlock break dormancy first, resulting in higher concentrations of sugars prior to Douglas-fir.
 
Damage may occur in even-aged or uneven-aged, single- or multi-species stands. Fast growing, highly productive sites tend to be at most risk. Bears are selective, targeting the most vigorous, healthiest, and fastest growing trees.
 
Certain silvicultural practices may inadvertently attract bears, resulting in an increased risk of damage. For example, damage frequently occurs after stand improvement practices, such as thinning, where an increase in productivity and sugar concentrations may make the trees more appetizing.
 
It is also important to note that black bears mark or scar trees for other reasons, including leaving scent and marking territory, especially during the rut. This may include biting or scarring trees 4 to 6 feet above the ground. Damage caused by this behavior is typically not severe.
 
Deciding if and when to take action can be difficult. For this reason, I recommend working with a forestry professional who can evaluate the damage, or potential for damage, and help come up with the best option based on your management goals and objectives.
