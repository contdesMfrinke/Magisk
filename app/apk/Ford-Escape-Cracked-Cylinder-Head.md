Presume the 4cyl model (if there is a v6 option I don't know...), and the stealer wants to throw a long block in it. With the dudes employer discount (he works for the stealer) they quoted him $6K to throw a "new" long block under the hood.
 
I have a hard time believing it's that hard to do an HG replacement on it, but what do I know, the cars I drive are 23, 29, and 40, and the older it gets the easier that job is to do (I think the 320 took me all of 2-3 hours).

IDK but AK1's CPO 2018 with 57k on it is sitting at the dealership waiting for a coolant leakdown and borescope test to see if they're going to "silent recall" replace the short block. I'm in a 2023 Edge Titanium loaner and AK1 is driving my 6MT RWD E92.
 
I'm betting the service manager knows that the techs are more likely to get an engine swap right than deal with potentially disassembling a head, sending it out to get skimmed, reassembling it, getting all of the timing set right, etc. A new long block is a sure thing and probably means less shop hours in reality.
 
Some 2014-2019 Fusion and 2017-2019 Escape vehicles equipped with a 1.5L Ecoboost engine may exhibit coolant consumption and white smoke concern. Follow the Cooling System Pressure Test procedure in Workshop Manual(WSM), Section 303-03, pressurize the cooling system to 138 kPa (20 psi) and hold for 5 hours. If cooling system pressure drops 27.57kPa(4psi) after 5 hours and internal engine coolant loss is confirmed, further investigation of the head gasket interface is required. Carefully inspect cylinder block for erosion, pitting, and flatness. Defects will be between the engine block cylinders and cylinder bore bridges. If defects with the surface of the cylinder block and/or cylinder head are identified, follow WSM, Section 303-01A procedures for repairs. Complete cost cap as needed to determine the most cost effective repair.
 
I've seen youtube clips about 4cyl turbo escape/lincoln engines having leaks in the block on cylinder 3. Symptoms may look like a head gasket leak, but it's actually a block. If you check the cylinder w/a boroscope you might actually see the coolant leaking into the cyl if you put the cooling system under pressure.
 
I was hoping this would not be a problem for AC's Escape, but the 2.0l turbos can have an issue with bore cracks. All I've heard of were the larger vehicles that load the engine higher more consistently.

What are the compression numbers on the other cylinders? If those are excellent then more than likely there is a valve issue on the low cylinder.
If so, you could probably get by with the repair of one cylinder head.
 
I have a 2001 ford escape and we recently changed the head gaskets and looks for leaks in the intake as well as their is no oil and water mixed the oil still looks fine but it sounds like it has a head gasket or a leak but I haven't been able to figure out what could make it do that. Is there anything else that could possibly make it sound like a tractor? Any help is appreciated.
 
Richard, this "sound like a tractor" is usually not a sign of a bad head gasket. What is the performance like? Any grey, black, blue smoke? Increased fuel consumption? You originally changed the head gasket because of the sound or did it make the sound after you worked on it? The more details you can give, the greater the likelihood to get a couple of valid answers....
 
I was only able to drive it for a short time I tried to drive it up a hill to try and get the engine to run smoothly but it ended up turning the car off and I havent been able to get it to start again yet. no black or blue or grey smoke I didn't get to drive it far. It was acting like it blew a cylinder head gasket and sounded like it would with that issue but there was a lack of the symptoms such as there was no antifreeze or any visible leaks or anything. I replaced them in hopes it would fix the problem and it seem to have made it worse they were installed correctly but i cannot find the source of the issue. the only symptom it is showing is that it had the sound you would normally hear with a head gasket issue or a intake issue but it was missing and sputtering like tractor would make. There is no physical symptoms and I have checked everything and it seems right but it still is not acting like it should.
 
Richard.2001-2007 Ford Escape have scanned for engine diagnostic codes as a first step to aid in diagnosing fault. Check/remove all spark plugs and check for washed out appearance that would indicate a problem ensure plugs and wires are tight, good connection and proper firing order. The tractor like sound you hear could be loose spark plug/s, an exhaust leak manifold/pipe/connection or EGR leaking. Links below have symptoms, replacement and location of EGR valve. Good luck.
 
A lack of coolant circulation could cause the engine to overheat, causing a crack in the cylinder head, according to Ford. If that happens, pressurized oil can leak through the crack, and if it hits a hot surface, could cause and engine fire. The company says it has 29 reports of fires in the U.S. and Canada, but no injuries.
