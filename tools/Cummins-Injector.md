Diesel fuel injectors are devices that are used to deliver fuel to the engine of a diesel-powered vehicle. They work by injecting a precise amount of fuel into the engine's combustion chamber at the right time, under high pressure. This helps to optimize the fuel-air mixture in the engine, which is necessary for efficient and effective combustion.There are several types of diesel fuel injectors, including mechanical, common rail, and unit injector systems. Mechanical fuel injectors use a mechanical linkage to open and close the injector valve, while common rail systems use high-pressure fuel pumps to deliver fuel to a central rail, which is then distributed to the individual injectors. Unit injector systems combine the fuel pump and injector into a single unit.Diesel fuel injectors are typically made of durable materials such as stainless steel or high-strength alloys, and are designed to withstand the high pressures and temperatures that are present in a diesel engine. They are an essential component of any diesel engine and play a crucial role in its performance and efficiency.
 
Scheid Diesel offers a wide variety of Dodge Cummins injectors. We offer stock and performance injectors from Bosch and Scheid Diesel. If you have any questions please call us at 1-800-669-1934.



 
BD-Built Performance injectors are assembled using OE procedures and fully calibrated and tested to ensure perfect operation. Performance injectors increase fuel quantity between 33%-53%, which equates to approximately 60hp-120hp.
 
**\*NOTE\*** Injector installation torque is critical to injector life and performance. Ensure the injector bore and injector seat are **SPOTLESSLY CLEAN** before installing. Debris/carbon can prevent injectors from sealing correctly which can create leaks or poor running complaints.
 
**\*NOTE\*** These injectors have **TRIM (IQA) CODES** that will need to be programmed into the ECM with a Scan Tool. Ensure the ECM has the correct trim codes programmed to get the longest life and best performance from the injectors. Contact us anytime if you require assistance.
 
The fuel injector is an integral part of any vehicles system as the car will not function without it. Knowing about your cars or trucks injectors will help you troubleshoot them if there is a problem in the system. Cummins is a company that makes a variety of styled engines and their pieces.
 
Gasoline or diesel is pumped into the engine bay to reach the injectors. The fuel injector can be compared to a hoses spray nozzle as it releases the fuel in a fine mist form. It is mixed with passing air and enters the connected cylinders for further distribution.

There are different aspects that define the kind of fuel injectors that a car or truck uses. Cummins has all types available. Some use continuous injection while others are timed. Whether the system is mechanically or electronically controlled will also be a factor. There are also surrounding aspects that relate to the injectors, including how much pressure is being sent to it and how much fuel is released from it. It is always recommended to refer to the vehicles manual or to have a mechanic take a look at the old fuel injector to determine which kind is the appropriate replacement.
 
If you experience the following issues with your vehicle, you might need to replace your fuel injectors. They can be dirty, worn, clogged, or have faltered. Testing them is key to ensure that there isnt a surrounding problem, such as a wiring issue.
 
A **unit injector** (**UI**) is a high-pressure integrated direct fuel injection system for diesel engines, combining the injector nozzle and the injection pump in a single component. The plunger pump used is usually driven by a shared camshaft. In a unit injector, the device is typically lubricated and cooled by the fuel itself.
 
High-pressure injection delivers power and fuel consumption benefits over earlier lower-pressure fuel injection by injecting fuel as a larger number of smaller droplets, giving a much higher ratio of surface area to volume. This provides improved vaporisation from the surface of the fuel droplets and so more efficient combining of atmospheric oxygen with vaporised fuel, delivering more complete and cleaner combustion.
 
Commercial usage of unit injectors in the U.S. began in early 1930s on Winton engines powering locomotives, boats, even US Navy submarines,[2] and in 1934, Arthur Fielden was granted U.S. patent No.1,981,913[3] on the unit injector design[4] later used for the General Motors two-stroke diesel engines. Most mid-sized diesel engines used a single pump and separate injectors, but some makers, such as Detroit Diesel[5] and Electro-Motive Diesel became well known for favouring unit injectors, in which the high-pressure pump is contained within the injector itself. E.W. Kettering's 1951 ASME presentation goes into detail about the development of the modern Unit injector.[6]Also Cummins PT (pressure-time) is a form of unit injection where the fuel injectors are on a common rail fed by a low-pressure pump and the injectors are actuated by a third lobe on the camshaft. The pressure determines how much fuel the injectors get and the time is determined by the cam.
 
In 1994, Robert Bosch GmbH supplied the first electronic unit injector for commercial vehicles, and other manufacturers soon followed. In 1995, Electromotive Diesel converted its 710 diesel engines to electronic fuel injection, using an EUI which replaces the UI.
 
The design of the unit injector eliminates the need for high-pressure fuel pipes, and with that, their associated failures, as well as allowing for much higher injection pressure to occur. The unit injector system allows accurate injection timing, and amount of control as in the common rail system .[12]
 
The unit injector is fitted into the engine cylinder head, where the fuel is supplied via integral ducts machined directly into the cylinder head. Each injector has its own pumping element, and in the case of electronic control, a fuel solenoid valve as well. The fuel system is divided into the low-pressure (
 
A low-pressure fuel delivery pump supplies filtered diesel fuel into the cylinder head fuel ducts, and into each injector fuel port of constant stroke pump plunger injector, which is overhead camshaft operated.
 
The use of electronic control allows for special functions; such as temperature controlled injection timing, cylinder balancing (smooth idle), switching off individual cylinders under part load for further reduction in emissions and fuel consumption, and multi-pulse injection (more than one injection occurrence during one engine cycle).
 
Unit injector fuel systems are being used on a wide variety of vehicles and engines; commercial vehicles from manufacturers such as Volvo, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, CAT, Navistar International and passenger vehicles from manufacturers such as Land Rover and Volkswagen Group, among others, and locomotives from Electromotive Diesel.
 
TDI engines incorporating PD unit injector systems manufactured by the Volkswagen Group were also installed on some cars sold in Europe and other markets where the diesel fuel was conveniently priced, amongst those there were some Chrysler/Dodge cars of the DaimlerChrysler era, e.g. the Dodge Calibre (MY07 BKD, MY08 BMR), Dodge Journey, Jeep Compass, Jeep Patriot.
 
Increasingly stringent emission norms have been one of the major driving forces behind the research in diesel engines for more innovative combustion strategies, after-treatment techniques and fuel injection systems. Multiple pulse injection strategies have been investigated to be effective in providing a trade-off to limit the exhaust emissions, noise and fuel consumption. Though multiple injection strategies are advantageous, they are challenging to monitor and control. Multiple injections behave differently in terms of injection parameters such as start of injection (SOI) delay, hydraulic duration and needle velocity which eventually leads to fueling variation for the same rail pressure and commanded on-time values. Thus, estimation and control strategies for single pulse injection are insufficient for multiple injection cases. To compensate for the fueling variation, the first step is to identify or estimate the fueling variation for the given case of multipulse injection. After the first pulse is injected, pressure waves are set up inside the injector body. This changes the initial conditions for the next injection. The current study focuses on the effect of these body pressure fluctuations to estimate the fueling variation in two-pulse cases. A hybrid modeling approach is followed to develop a simple model for the lower body of the injector to estimate the mass flow rate and fueling. The model is calibrated using an optimization technique to compute a set of coefficients defining the given injector configuration using a set of simulated single pulse injection cases. These coefficients are implemented to estimate the fueling and calculate the fueling variation (i.e. delta fueling) for the second pulse of a two-pulse case by using a simulated body pressure signal. The results of the technique are discussed for a number of rail pressure, commanded on-time and hydraulic separation values. The injectors under study
