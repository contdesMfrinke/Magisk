The words talk of transience, and the awareness of one\u2019s place in the universe. Poets come, poets go, he says. The song I\u2019m sharing with you today is a beautiful melody composed by Ravi and sung by Asha Bhosle. It\u2019s a song that is particularly apt for the moment, and I implore you to revisit it, and let its gentle rhythm wash over you. It talks about the joy of this moment, of living so completely in the present that everything else starts to slowly fade out. One doesn\u2019t know what is to come, one doesn\u2019t really know the past, it is best to make the most of the present. The melody is heady, and there is so much itminaan in its airy pathways, that it felt like the perfect song to momentarily lay one\u2019s head down in, and find repose from all that is happening.

I have shared the original lyrics in Devnagri and Roman, and I have shared below a somewhat shaky translation that nevertheless conveys a gist of the song. There\u2019s a Youtube link to the song and its picturisation in Waqt.
 
Unknown shadows set camps in our paths
Unseen arms have embraced us all
This moment is shining, the rest is darkness
Don't waste this moment, this moment is yours
O breathing spirit, think about it
This is the time to fulfil your heart\u2019s desires

The joy of this moment has graced this party
The heat of this moment has made my heart race
Because this moment exists, the world is ours 
This moment is more valuable then ages
O breathing soul, think about it
This is the time to fulfil your heart\u2019s desires

Our place is in the shadows of this moment 
Beyond this moment everything is a story
Who has seen tomorrow, who knows about it?
In this moment you'll attain all that you want
O breathing soul, think fast
This is the time to fulfil your heart\u2019s desires
 
Lata Mangeshkar did not like singing cabaret songs and music directors would usually prefer Asha Bhosle for singing them. This song is an exception. The song was tuned and styled in accordance with Lata's style and preference. When asked about the song Lata Mangeshkar laughed and said, "I remember telling Laxmikant not to give me any cabaret songs to sing. He assured me I could sing it without a hitch. Aa jaan-e-jaan was tailored to suit my taste and style." The song became an instant hit on the charts with Helen dancing syn chronically with the complete song.[3]
 
A remixed version of the song was also featured in the dance music album, *Dance Masti Forever* (2006) by band, *Instant Karma* as *Aa Jaan-E-Jaan (The Baby Can You Feel The Magic Mix)*.

The story begins as four friends travel with a guest to an airport, when Jignesh "Jiggy" Patel, Ravindran "Rotlu" Sahu, Sandhya "Bombs" Sahay and Shaleen Varma offer to tell Jiggy's date, air hostess Mala Mishra, the unique love story of Jai and Aditi, two friends who they have known. Jai "Ratz" Singh Rathore is the most non-violent Rajput to have ever existed, while Aditi "Meow" Mahant is an impulsive girl. Her nickname is the result of her abuse and scratching of people.
 
Despite their differences, Jai and Aditi are best friends in college. They seem perfectly meant for each other, a fact acknowledged by everyone except the two themselves. Aditi often has a bickering relationship with her brother Amit, who seems to hate Jai because of his polite and cool nature, and since Aditi cannot stand any insults against Jai, she regularly picks up fights with him. Aditi dreams of a virile, macho husband, while Jai wants a sweet, romantic girl. Since they do not believe that they are in love, they search for a perfect life partner for each other after finishing college. Jai falls in love with Meghna Pariyar after spotting her in a club where two rough men were misbehaving with her. He rescues her by tricking the duo, thus winning Meghna's heart. When Meghna and Jai get close to each other, Rotlu, Jiggy, Sandhya, and Shaleen are happy for Jai, but nobody notices that Aditi is missing Jai's company. Meghna informs Jai that her parents squabble but cannot live without each other. Jai visits Meghna's parents and sees that her father, Mahesh, is an alcoholic who has much friction with his ex-wife Sheela. Due to the meeting, he misses Aditi's surprise birthday party. Realizing that he missed the occasion, he goes late at night to wish her but is sent back after a conversation between the two culminates in Aditi asking him to leave.
 
Feeling deserted, Aditi gets engaged to her father's friend's son, Sushant Modi. She sees in him the macho man she always wanted. However, Sushant is also a spoilt playboy whose ex-girlfriend, Richa, has landed him in trouble twice. Amit, upon having a word with Sushant in person, tries to make her see Sushant for who he really is but Aditi continues her relationship, considering that Jai is still with Meghna. At Jiggy's birthday party, where Jai and Meghna are also present, Aditi introduces Sushant to everyone. Both Jai and Aditi are upset with each other's relationship. During a romantic dance, Sushant finds that Aditi is crying and kisses her, which upsets Jai further.
 
Meghna tries to cheer him up, but Jai becomes angrier, shouting at her and chiding her for being ignorant of the friction between her parents. She breaks down and tells him about her parents' divorce due to Mahesh's extramarital affair which affected her psychologically, leading her to imagine a perfect world and be childish so as to not be burdened with the reality of being a forced thread between her parents. The next day, Jai breaks up with Meghna whereby she is shattered to learn that he loves Aditi and leaves with a goodbye kiss. As for Aditi, she is under duress from Sushant, who, after realizing she loves Jai, slaps her on her face, leaving a bruise. She decides to break the engagement and go to New York to study alone, while actually wanting to return to Jai. When she meets Jai, he spots the bruise on Aditi's face, and contrary to his usual non-violent nature, goes to Sushant's house and beats him up for daring to lay a hand on Aditi.
 
Inspector P.K. Waghmare, who is at odds with Jai's mother Savitri Singh Rathore, arrests Jai for thrashing Sushant and puts him behind bars. Later that night, while still in prison, he meets the two men who were found harassing Meghna at the club and is surprised to see them celebrating their imprisonment. They tell him that for a boy to become a man in their clan, he must complete three conditions: 1) thrash someone 2) get arrested 3) ride a horse. As they narrate to Jai the story of their adventures in Mumbai and mention that it wouldn't have been possible for them to fulfill these conditions in Ranjhor, he inadvertently reveals his credentials as a native of Ranjhor, which causes the two men, seemingly brothers to each other, to sit up and decipher his identity. Once he mentions that he is the son of the late Amar Singh Rathore and the two men confirm that his mother's name is Savitri, they clutch him to the ground in joy, and he discovers in an epiphany when they address him as "Mowgli" that the brothers are his long-lost cousins, Kuber "Baloo" Singh Rathore and Vinay "Bagheere" Singh Rathore, from whom he had been separated in childhood. Jai, who has already fulfilled the first two conditions required for becoming a man in the Rathore clan, finally comes to terms with his legacy, realizing that Amar was actually never the non-violent type Savitri had painted him as and that she was lying to him all along.
 
Meanwhile, Aditi makes her way to the international airport to depart for New York. Baloo and Bagheere, who are sons of Amar's cousin, now an MLA, use their influence to bail Jai out, after which Jai rides to the airport on a borrowed horse to stop Aditi from leaving. This makes him fulfill the final condition, and an initially worried Savitri, after spotting him, decides to return home, dejected that Amar's dream has come true. Jai finds Aditi at the airport lounge and sings her the titular song which he had confessed earlier as the one he would sing for the love of his life. Aditi, delighted, hugs him and cancels her travel plans. Back in the present, Rotlu, Jiggy, Sandhya, and Shaleen
