In 1971, Amandeep "Aman" Singh IPS is a deep cover RAW field operative, who is in Pakistan on an undercover assignment under the pseudonym Tariq Hussain. Along the way, Aman falls in love with Nasreen Hussain, a blind girl and the two get married. In May 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test, due to which Pakistan secretly rushed to build its own nuclear weapon with the help of nuclear engineer Abdul Qadeer Khan.
 
During the 1977 Indian general election campaign, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is appraised of the situation by RAW Chief R. N. Kao, and she directs him to find the location of the nuclear facility. Kao assigns the mission to Aman. Aman's handler, Sharma, informs him of his new mission named "Mission Majnu". Along the way, Aman meets two other RAW agents - Aslam Usmaniya and Raman Singh (under the pseudonym Maulvi Saab), who are stationed in Pakistan. Aman manages to gather information that Pakistan is indeed making a nuclear weapon.
 
Following a general election in India, a new government is formed and its new leader and new Prime Minister Morarji Desai believes in building relationships through diplomacy and peaceful means, and is against any form of warfare including spying and intelligence gathering. Kao resigns to keep the operation in Pakistan going, and hidden from the Prime Minister. In the meantime, Israel is readying an attack on the Quetta military facility, wrongly believing it to be a nuclear weapon facility. Aman manages to locate the nuclear facility in Kahuta, but is unable to collect physical evidence.
 
Sharma discovers that Israel is going to attack Quetta in 48 hours. Aman goes back to Kahuta and collects hair of Army personnel working in the nuclear facility, which he secretively sends to India, where it is tested and found to contain trace of radiation, pointing to the presence of plutonium in Kahuta. Israel's attack on Quetta is averted. The matter is disclosed to Desai in light of new evidence, where he weighs in on Pakistan counterparts and Pakistan's inability to be trusted. ISI hunts down and kills covert RAW agents operating in Pakistan including Aman's colleagues Aslam and Raman.

Aman tries to escape to Dubai with a pregnant Nasreen, who is unaware that ISI agents are chasing them. Aman distracts ISI agents long enough to let Nasreen board an aeroplane and leave unhindered but is killed in the process. Nasreen lands in Dubai, where she meets Kao at the airport and reads a letter from Aman revealing his true identity. She breaks down after reading the letter and the movie then ends with her crying while remembering her love.

Sidharth Malhotra in kurta pyjama, with kohl-rimmed eyes, plays an R&AW agent in Pakistan who marries an innocent girl and using her as a cover in his mission to expose a nuclear facility. Mission Majnu boasts of a winner plot that's high on patriotism and heroic deeds. It is emotional, engaging and exciting. But, the experience is marred by too many easy coincidences and loopholes that are hard to ignore. Ahead of Republic Day, Director Shantanu Bagchi pays a tribute to all heroes who don't wear a uniform and sacrifice their lives for their motherland. However, the story, jointly written by Aseem Arrora, Sumit Batheja and Parveez Shaikh, falters at several places and doesn't let Mission Majnu hit hard.
 
Set in the '70s, Mission Majnu narrates the story of Amandeep Ajitpal Singh disguised as Tariq (Sidharth), who is sick of being called the son of a traitor, but now wants to clear the name for his mother. He is on a covert mission in Pakistan to expose a nuclear weapons program. He is joined by two more undercover Indian spies played brilliantly by Sharib Hashmi and Kumud Mishra and it's their camaraderie that elevates the film. Like any other spy-thriller, there's a love angle, this time with the visually impaired Nasreen (Rashmika Mandanna) who has no clue about his mission. Back home in India, the government has changed and wants to mend their ways with Pakistan, yet the R&AW chief (Parmeet Sethi) continues the mission with his men in the neighbouring nation. There's too much chaos, confusion which leads to a familiar climax yet gives you goosebumps. On learning that several R&AW agents are living in Pakistan, the shootout that follows killing almost everyone on the radar is a rather well-shot sequence. Special mention to the portions where Kumud and Sharib's characters are targeted.
 
Sidharth leaves you with no complaints and is once again in top form, with a charming onscreen presence. Full marks to the way he has picked the dialect and the way he emotes. Rashmika brings a freshness to the film but doesn't have much to do. With limited scenes, there's not much you can expect from her character to take forward the story.
 
While Sidharth puts forth his best foot forward, after winning accolades for portraying an army officer in Shershaah (2021), it's Mission Majnu's weak story that somewhere hampers his performance and that's quite disappointing. It's understandable that an undercover agent isn't supposed to follow set norms and has to behave as normally as possible, but I couldn't wrap my head around the presence of so many frivolous dialogues and scenes to establish his character. Moreover, the way things happen -- whether it's him landing at the Brigadier's residence and trying to extract information about where Pakistan's nuclear plant is located or getting on board Samjhauta Express without any papers or passport, posing as a Sikh, and then following a fight on top of the train and eventually managing a clean escape -- all this gets a bit too much to digest after a point. I mean it sounds hilarious how makers equipped Tariq with this super power to crack the most difficult tasks and instantly act on them. Be it how an X-ray machine emits harmful radiations or how the foreigners would still use an English toilet in the '70s, you'd be amazed to see how he gets ideas from these situations that takes him a step closer to his mission.
 
That being said, Mission Majnu is an entertaining watch that somewhere wants you to only look at the hero in the frame and not question how things are unfolding on screen. The film is now streaming on Netflix.
 
At the end of this year, I plan on listing down some of the most patently ludicrous scenes from Bollywood 2023. Something tells me it will be rich pickings. I already have a contender: the climactic highpoint of Mission Majnu.
 
After India successfully tests its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran, Pakistan wants to do the same. 
They fly in scientists and build a secretive nuclear facility somewhere on the edges of Rawalpindi. To determine its exact location becomes the mission of Tariq Ali (Sidharth Malhotra), actually a RAW agent named Amandeep.
 
Director Shantanu Bagchi makes some choices to set up the story as he breaks it into pieces. First the historical element of nuclear warfare, then the love story between an Indian man and a Pakistani woman, and lastly, the double life these agents lead.
 
It is set to have an emotional tie because of the relationship and the fact they are from two different backgrounds. So Bagchi also poses the question if love can conquer all in the face of adversity.
 
The film is based on a true story of an important covert spy mission that took place in the **Indo-Pakistani War of 1971**. The mission was known as an untold story, despite the importance of the nature of the operation, that was said to have changed political relationships afterward.
 
The film was written by Parveez Shaikh. Aseem Arrora and Sumit Batheja all three writers have a lot of experience writing for both film and TV, so it would appear that the three writers involved may have been brought on to work extensively on the script. For three writers of this caliber to all work on the same project may insinuate that the script was reworked, and this may be part of the reason for the many delays that the film experienced.
 
However, with many other properties, such as Maidaan, and Doctor G, also missing their deadlines, it is most likely that the delays started with the Covid pandemic. Another major factor was the release of**Jurassic World Dominion**.
 
This blockbuster was to be released in June 2022, and this clashed with Mission Majnu, which had already been rescheduled for the same date. In an effort to avert a clash for the two films, it was decided that Mission Majnu would be held back, resulting in its eventual release in January 2023.

Mission Majnu, while adopting a narrative inspired by reality, leans heavily on fiction, primarily focusing on the character Ama
