For all file-related tasks, including downloading files from FTP and network locations, it performed quickly without, as I mentioned, slowing down my system. The integrity of the backups was perfect.

**Before you begin:** You must have a Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage account. If you already have a Backblaze account and the left navigation menu contains a **B2 Cloud Storage** section, your account is already enabled for Backblaze B2.
 
Use Iperius to backup your data to IDrive e2 hot cloud storage. Iperius Backup, allows you to create automated backups of files and folders stored on various devices and services such as external USB hard drives, RDX drives, Cloud Storage, NAS, Amazon S3, Google Drive, and FTP servers.

Keeping multiple copies of your backups will help greatly reduce that risk. I believe I heard a while ago that there was a version of ransomware that would sit for a few weeks before triggering so it would get into your backups also. ( 11 ransomware trends for 2018 | CSO Online )

As already mentioned above, multiple times, even if the backup software or antivirus is capable of detecting previously known types of ransomware, there is always a probability of being hit by something new. The best protection against ransomware is having a decent backup strategy and following the 3-2-1 rule -2-1-backup-rule-data-will-always-survive/ .
 
This is another reason why the 3-2-1 rule is so important. An off site copy of your backup is much less vulnerable to the same attack as your on premise data. I also consider this a significant risk of Windows based backup products like Veeam. I do believe that you can secure your Veeam backups, but I also believe that it is very easy to leave them exposed.
 
I also found Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows FREE has an option to enter the NAS credentials in the backup Veeam software repository, so the UNC path is not actually mapped or accessible directly from the server
 
OP - Just in case you ever decide to look for other options, I wanted to make sure to pass along our Ransomware Protection page where you can get a clear picture on what and how we handle ransomware: Whitepaper: Protecting Your Data From Ransomware

I'm currently trying to install a new tape backup environment (LTO 7, hardware is already set up). As LTO 7 tapes provide a LOT of data space (6/15TB per tape), and the backups that need to be stored on tape will not exceed 0.5TB per day, it would be a charm if there was a way to store more than only one (consecutive) backup set on each cassette. Target would be to have one tape per week, with daily backups on it.
 
Environment is Windows 10 tower PC with external LTO 7 streamer device. Backups get there via FTP batch script over night. I started testing with Iperius Backup, as they were recommended a lot because of their price/functionality ratio. Sadly, Iperius can only handle one backup set per tape.
 
Therefore, I'm on the look for another tape backup software that's capable of the backup plan I described here. As I wrote earlier, Google did not provide a software solution for this issue, so now I'm putting my hope in the community here.
 
Bacula and Bareos does this well. They are able to write to the tape until it is full, then they ask for another tape. AFAIK they are Linux only, except that they do have a Windows client agent for backing up Windows pc-s, but the central server(s) must run Linux.
 
However, according to my experience these are complex and somewhat fragile softwares. Considering that you already have the data to backup on one machine via ftp, first I would just try a shell script from a cron job which append one or more tar files to the tape and email you every week to change the tape.

Iperius Backup is a backup software and synchronization utility compatible with all Windows platforms. The software is released in different editions: there is a freeware version with limited functionalities, followed by professional editions with advanced features.
 
Iperius Backup is a disk cloning software that can create drive image backups to VHD and VHDX files. Image backups can be created in two modes: using the Iperius proprietary engine, that creates an image file that can be immediately started as a VM into Hyper-V (this backup mode can also be called "P2V", since it can be used to virtualize physical machines), or using the Windows Image Backup engine (wbadmin). Iperius Backup supports the Windows drive imaging (block-level) backup. The disk image created by Iperius Backup can be used to restore the system even on a dissimilar hardware (hardware independent restore). It is also possible to restore individual files and folders.
 
Iperius Backup is a virtual machine backup software. It can create full, incremental and differential backups (CBT/VDDK) of ESXi and ESXi Free virtual machines. The backup is agentless and the destination of VM backups can be LTO tape drives, NAS devices, cloud storage services like S3 or Google Drive, FTP servers and any mass storage device.
 
Iperius Backup can replicate virtual machines between ESXi hosts and datastores. Incremental replication is also supported, to create cloned virtual machines and update them at block level, with only modified blocks on the virtual disks. Replication works also for ESXi Free, using ESXi Free hosts as replication source and target.
 
Iperius Backup is a Hyper-V backup software. It can create hot backups of virtual machines running on the local server or on other servers reachable by the network. The backup is agentless and the destination of VM backups can be LTO tape drives, NAS devices, cloud storage services like S3 or Google Drive, FTP servers and any mass storage device.
 
Iperius Backup is software for FTP backup on any type of server or NAS. Iperius can send backups to a remote server with a few configurations, with the secure FTPS protocol and also with zip compression and AES 256 bit encryption.
