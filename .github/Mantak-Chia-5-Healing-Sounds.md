Do you recall hearing traffic noise from afar, a sleepless night when neighbors are partying several blocks away, or joyful sounds of children laughing in a distant playground? Sound waves have the power to penetrate through cement walls and glass windows. They have a significant impact on our brains as well, as they vibrate through the nervous system and soft tissues of the human body. The sounds we absorb and the sounds we voice have significant impact on our daily experiences.

**The six healing sounds** are primary, pre-language vocal expressions. Regardless of culture, race, or geographical location, babies all over the world express these sounds prior to communication through words. According to the Taoist teaching of Chi Nei Tsang, the six healing sounds are associated with the 5 Elements and the Navel Gate.
 
Chinese medicine views the internal organs as containers of the qi, our life force energy, including our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects. The healing sounds help to harmonize the qi vibrations amongst all these aspects. By using a specific vowel, sound waves access a particular organ and open up energetic blocks and stagnation, restoring flow and vitality.
 
**Toning the six healing sounds** is a powerful practice that preserves our connection to our primary instincts as infants, assisting in nurturing and rejuvenating the internal organs throughout our life.

Toning requires deep breaths with long exhalations to vocalize the sound. This brings calmness to the entire nervous system, allowing us to open blocked qi, balance the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual vibrations, transform unsupportive feelings or thoughts, and enhance our health and wellbeing.
 
**Feelings**are the languishing of sensations, in which the emotions communicate with the physical body. They bridge between the subtle vibrations and the tangible aspects of our physical experience. Balancing the emotions supports the healing of physical symptoms enhancing flow and vitality.
 
There are many therapeutic applications of the healing sounds. I still recall the profound experience at my first exploration of these sounds in a Chi Nei Tsang training course. Various sensations and symptoms in my body began to make sense and heal. I learned to recognize them as energetic blocks calling for attention.
 
**CNT internal organ** **manipulations** **:** to support the functions of the organs for purification and rejuvenation with hands-on techniques while toning the sounds.
 
**Qi/yoga/meridians stretch:**combines the healing sounds with qigong movements, yoga, meridians stretch, and meditations. This practice deepens the connection to our core, to the breath, to oneself, and to others. It strengthens the physical body, calms the emotions, and harmonizes our yin and yang energy flow for rejuvenation and relaxation.
 
In our divided world of systematic race, cultural hate, aggression and survival challenges, practice with healing sounds helps to unite us all as human beings. It brings us back to our pre-language authentic self, so that we may bridge our differences, heal, and find peace within and without.
 
The training video is an excerpt from a 2021 workshop at the Universal Healing Tao Center in Thailand. You can find the entire course as a recording on our website, www.mantak-chia-media.com.
It was Grandmaster Mantak Chia who was instrumental in making the Six Healing Sounds known in the West. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the 5 yin organs heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen are a life-sustaining whole to which the Six Healing Sounds refer.
The aim of the exercises is nothing less than emotional harmonisation.

Listeners can consider utilizing this music for enhancing their health in general and for support with specific health concerns. Listed below are health concern indications from the tradition of Chinese medicine that are relevant to the Water Element:

Lower back pain, lower extremity weakness, urinary issues, low libido, anxiety, prolonged sleep, and hair loss.

Note: Brain research shows that when the listener of healing music actively participates while listening (e.g., repeating out loud the healing breathing sounds or moving the entire body in a rhythmic manner), an enhanced, measurable sensation of well-being is noted along with an increased potential for healing and a more profound beneficial effect on the brain.

Two recommended ways to increase listener participation and benefit :
1. Listen to the music while holding the intention to be open to any personal affirmations that spontaneously come to mind. Write down your own personal affirmation(s). Then, on subsequent listening to the music, repeat the affirmation(s) at a very slow pace for the entire 45 minutes of the track or for as long as you are comfortable.
2. Refer to the enclosed literature that describes the Qi Gong breathing sounds for each element. Then, as you listen to the music, actively do the breathing sounds along with the music for as long as you are comfortable.

Most of you heard of the "inner smile" practice, popularized in the West by Mantak Chia. I've been through a few thousands of English books on Taoism, esp. books on practice, but somehow never seen the Chinese term for this practice. I also don't remember seeing this practice in any book other than Chia's books.
 
AFAIC the inner smile practice is very similar to one of the fundamental practices from vipassana or other similar systems. In daoism there are countless practices similar to the inner smile. Any teacher can make up their own names for the practices so for me the names don't really matter. What matters is what they do to the body.
 
Of course hacking something fundamental like Sung basically makes it useless beyond a very shallow level. Sung has many layers and depths. Sung is the application of non-contrived action - Wei Wu Wei.
 
Inner smile was one of the first practices I began doing. I learned the Chia version but would combine it with the healing sounds. So inner smile and the matching color/attributes breathing in, and healing sound breathing out. I was surprised because it began to release all sorts of stuck emotions in the organs which I was not expecting nor prepared for.
 
Dear El Tortugo, have you seen this in any book? A part of a book describing the Small Heavenly Cycle practice which also contain the inner smile practice as a part of it. I'll be very happy if you can give me a reference. Just the name of the book is enough, if you don't remember the details like chapter, page, and so on.
 
Lots of people like to rip on Master Chia, perhaps with good reason. But Ive always regarded his "inner smile" practice as one of the best, least-likely-to-do-harm practices in his system. Is it, as Freeform says, simplified for westerners? Is it a backasswards perversion of a traditional method? Oh probably. But if, like me, youd like to include a backasswards simplified-for-westerners practice or two in your spiritual arsenal, the inner smile is, in my opinion, a good choice.
 
This was actually an interesting statement that caused me to think. I will for example try a new mantra and feel all sorts of effects and be aware of what its doing to my mind and my energy and be totally blown away and then in my enthusiasm to see if these effects are replicated in others, I will get a friend or two to try the mantra. I'll give them a little time to try it and then when I ask them what they notice they usually say they didn't really notice anything one way or the other. Once this happens enough times I begin to wonder why my experience seems to be so different. So reading your take on it makes me just assume I am wired a bit differently lol.
